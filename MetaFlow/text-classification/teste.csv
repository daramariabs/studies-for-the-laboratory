And when the night is cloudy,1
There is still a light that shines on me,1
Shine on until tomorrow,1
Let it be,1
I wake up to the sound of music,1
Mother Mary comes to me,1
Speaking words of wisdom,1
Let it be,1
"Let it be, let it be",1
"Let it be, let it be",1
There will be an answer,1
Let it be,1
Yesterday,1
All my troubles seemed so far away,1
Now it looks as though they're here to stay,1
"Oh, I believe in yesterday",1
Suddenly,1
I'm not half the man I used to be,1
There's a shadow hanging over me,1
"Oh, yesterday came suddenly",1
Why she had to go I don't know,1
She wouldn't say,1
I said something wrong now I long,1
For yesterday,1
Yesterday,1
Love was such an easy game to play,1
Now I need a place to hide away,1
"Oh, I believe in yesterday",1
Why she had to go I don't know,1
She wouldn't say,1
I said something wrong now I long,1
For yesterday,1
I can't get no satisfaction,2
I can't get no satisfaction,2
"'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try",2
I can't get no,2
I can't get no,2
When I'm drivin' in my car,2
And that man comes on the radio,2
He's tellin' me more and more,2
About some useless information,2
Supposed to drive my imagination,2
I can't get no,2
"Oh, no, no, no",2
"Hey, hey, hey",2
That's what I say,2
I can't get no satisfaction,2
I can't get no satisfaction,2
"'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try",2
I can't get no,2
I can't get no,2
When I'm watchin' my TV,2
And that man comes on to tell me,2
How white my shirts can be,2
"But he can't be a man, 'cause he doesn't smoke",2
The same cigarettes as me,2
I can't get no,2
"Oh, no, no, no",2
"Hey, hey, hey",2
That's what I say,2
I can't get no satisfaction,2
I can't get no girl reaction,2
"'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try",2
I can't get no,2
I can't get no,2
When I'm ridin' round the world,2
And I'm doin' this and I'm signing that,2
And I'm tryin' to make some girl,2
"Who tells me, baby, better come back later next week",2
'Cause you see I'm on losing streak,2
I can't get no,2
"Oh, no, no, no",2
"Hey, hey, hey",2
That's what I say,2
I can't get no,2
I can't get no,2
I can't get no satisfaction,2
No satisfaction,2
No satisfaction,2
No satisfaction,2
I can't get no,2

We attempted to reach you by telephone iinmediately but were unable to find a listed number in New Haven. I had hoped to arrange an appointment for one of our executives to discuss with you and your concerned friends the matter you have brought up in your letter. First of all, let me advise you that there is absolutely no asbestos or any other foreign materials in the filter of any of our cigarettes. There has never been any asbestos, in any form, in any cigarette ever manufactured by Philip Morris Incorporated. You have sttated in your letter that you heard otherwise on a televised newscast. We would very much appreciate your advising us of the .newscast and/or the television channel through which you heard this grievously incorrect Statement. We would certainly be able to obtain an immediate retraction and correction. I would also appreciate if you would call my Office—collect—at: (212) 880-3555. I would like to arrange with you for one of our people to personally discuss this matter with you and your friends at a time convenient to you. The untrue and totally unfounded charges you have brought against Marlboro Lights cigarettes are of great concern to me and I would like to arrange an opportun!ty for one of our people to further clarify this subject with you. Please call me and •we can make the arrangements.                                  ....continued.... 1005063373"

The Original Participating Manufacturers agree that such costs and expenses are generally reimbursabie as expenses incurred “in connection with” the relevant litigation, provided they comply with the other Standards set forth in the Fee Payment Agreement. However, the Original Participating Manufacturers are not prepared to reimburse costs and expenses incurred by a Settling State or Liiigating Political Subdivision (or its counsel) in connection with post-approval actions, proceedings or activities ofthat eintity (or its counsel) that are adverse to the Original Participating Manufacturers, violate the MSA, or are in Opposition to the attamment of StaU> Specific Finality.

MARLBORO, the MARLBORO Roof Design, and the combination thereof are all trademarks owned by Philip Morris. In addition, we also own United States Registration No. 1400689 for MARLBORO WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM (& racing car), (& Red Roof Design), which covers ""entertainment Services, namely conducting car racing events."" Similar rights are in existence in almost every country world-wide. Accordingly, the usage of our trademarks and those confusingly similar therewith infringe our trademark rights under federal and state laws, our common law trademark and state unfair competition rights, and our rights under national and international laws in other countries.       In the circumstances, we must demand that you cease all such usage and that you recall all games currently existing in the marketplace. It will be appreciated, that as long as these games remain in the marketplace, they constitute continuing infringements of our rights in and to the MARLBORO, MARLBORO Roof Device, and MARLBORO & Roof Device trademarks and tradedress. Moreover, this demand should be considered as one also for your parent Company, to the extent that such games are in the marketplace in other countries.       This is an extremely serious matter to us, and we therefore must have your favorable reply without delay, in the hopes that we can yet resolve the matter amicably, and without resort to litigation.

Moreover, while cigarettes are our major product, substantial business is done in several areas and, as you are also, no doubt, aware, MARLBORO.Sponsors several race cars and racing teams around the world, including the world Champion MARLBORO-McLaren racing team.       MARLBORO, the MARLBORO Roof Design, and the combination thereof are all trademarks owned by Philip Morris. In addition, we also own United States Registration No. 1400689 for MARLBORO WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM (& racing car), (& Red Roof Design), which covers ""entertainment Services, namely conducting car racing events."" Similar rights are in existence in almost every country world-wide. Accordingly, the usage of our trademarks and those confusingly similar therewith infringe our trademark rights under federal and state laws, our common law trademark and state unfair competition rights, and our rights under national and international laws in other countries.       In the circumstances, we must demand that you cease all such usage and that you recall all games currently existing in the marketplace. It will be appreciated, that as long as these games remain in the marketplace, they constitute continuing infringements of our rights in and to the MARLBORO, MARLBORO Roof Device, and MARLBORO & Roof Device trademarks and tradedress. Moreover, this demand should be considered as one also for your parent Company, to the extent that such games are in the marketplace in other countries.       This is an extremely serious matter to us, and we therefore must have your favorable reply without delay, in the hopes that we can yet resolve the matter amicably, and without resort to litigation.

The article asserts that I warned the industry ""might return to practices such as cartoon advertising if Congress falls to graut protection from lawsuits."" As the attached transcript shows, this was a completeiy inaccurate account of the remarks I made.  i            On Februaxy 17, J raet with a grcup of reporters to discuss the industry's position regarding the civil liability provisions of the proposed tobacco resalution. Along with many Constitational scholars, we believe that many of the advertising and marketing restrictions contained in the June 20 proposed resolution cannot be Implemented without industry agreement because of Constitutional protections. The purpose of the briefing was to educate reporters about this matter and also to   CO   o\   cn   NO   KD   KD   KD  O'J"

Quring the session, David Rosenbaom of The New York Times asked me the following guestion:                  ""It sonnds to me as i£ what you're saying is, xf you don/t get protection from lawsuits, then you're going to return to having cartoon characters in ads and celebrities,'and continue to have billboard^ads, and you7 re going to do all things that you've säid in the settloment, you've agreed in the settlement not to do.                  Xs that a correct Interpretation?^                  After repeating the question for reporters who were participating by telephone, I answered:                   ""There are certaxnly going to be some things that the industry will continue dning that critics of the industry would not like to have going on. I can't teil you what tfaey will be. And each Company is going to have to reach that deeision individually, (Emphasxs added.)                  As is plain from the relevant excerpt of the transcript (which I enclose), I did not discuss any specific advertising or marketing practxces the industry might continue if there Is no legislated tobacco settlement. None of the Companies is currently usxng cartoon advertising and I spoke only of the . industry continuing to do some of the things it is currently doing.                  It was the USA Today reporter who inferred, incorrectly and unfairly, that I had cited cartoon characters. It was therefore wrong for USA Today to claim that I had opened the possibility of a return to the use of cartoon characters. X would further note that none of the other reporters who attended the briefing wrote aboat the alleged ""warning"" that USA Today exted. I hope you will agree that more Important than this misunderstanding by one newspaper about my remarks was the testimony Tuesday by the tobacco Company chief executive orficers that they would not use cartoon characters in the future.

If you (TIRC) are truly interested in an integrated program from the oral cavity to the blood stream, I suggest that the larger proposal be considered. From our point of view it represents a great deal of effort with the highest probability of making a concrete contribution to the uniqueness of the cigarette smoking phenomenon.   Any efforts that you can make to focus your Advisory Board1 s Cooperation in this direction will be appreciated.   It appears töatfnp' thai.yöü:.and Dr. Little are in an advantageous position to work with N. C. I. on recommendationsand cooperative undertakings. With Dr. Kotin on your board an ideal liason could be effected with N. C. I. and other groups in N. I. H. who are concerned with these problems.   In terms of capability we have the confidence that we are in a better position than most to tool up and redirect our efforts without sacrificing existing programs.   Very truly yours, Vincent F.

Given the relatively short notice that Companies have had on these new requirements in Mississippi, various members of the industry are encountering difficulty in meeting the August 1 deadline* I would respeotfully request that in the instance of this first disclosure only, the signatories of the agreement be pemitted an extension to August 14, 1998* Your assistance on this would be greatly appreciated.

We can set up a meeting here to review the format/data request list to determine what we can have Mike O'Neill and Gene Bonnett dig up and punch out. I would like to get together next week.                  You are also going to be asked to comment on the Tampa/Milwaukee international label test results. But first we must quantify the discussed distribution problems before we can ask for your comments on the Situation.                  Finally, the Agency's Position is sought on the overall ""big picture"" of the evolving change in strategy to an anti-NOW focus. Is it shortsighted or on target? Is battling over ""lowest"" a brand lifesaving imperative or a fight for a decreasingly relevant niche within a niche? Do the changes in the roster of ULT brands over the last few years and activity at the top half of ultra low (4,5 and 6 mg.) suggest changes in our marketing and advertising philosophy?                  Give me a call when you've had a chance to digest these requests and we can set up a response schedule and review any questions. Cordially, Thomas M.

Four samples should be manufactured, in which the main variables will be DUX-3 vs. LN-1, and 556 vs. TLP paper. A repeat of 323007 will servc as a control for the series which is: Code   323008 323009  323010 323011   Elend   LN-1  LN-1    D'JX-3  DUX-3   Casing   77     77      82     82     Flavor  944     944    950     950    Paper   556   553 TLP  556   553 TLP  The filters will all be of the same construction:       an 8 mm bed of BPL coal-base carbcm treated with 33% includcd water and 1% propylene glycol, betwecn two 8.5 mm sections of 3,9 x 40,000 acetatc. K&D evaluations and Manufacturing require-mente will select either 20 x 50 or 12 x 30 mesh carbon. The use of TLP paper should increase puff number, reduce tar, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, The casing and flavor for the DUX-3 blend are modified to increase the flavor level. The problern of external testing of charcoal filters has been aired with Market Research. Mo decision has been reached yet as to the test method which will be employed. We recommend, however, that each sample be assigned a Market Research code, and that quantities sufficient for 100 respondents be prepared, It is antic.ipated that two samples will be so.lected at B&W from the four made, for die actual market tests, The timing suggested for this exercise is: Assembly of filter rods; Assembly of cigarettes; Results of R&D analyses: Recommandations for market test: Top Line results: HWM/jnh/323 KSYWORD INDEX:  Week Commencirtg  June 2 June 9 June 23 June 30 August 18  Charcoal Filters, Carbon, D'JX-3, LN- CC; Mr. E.

As I reported to Mr. Beck in our discussion —   on February 23rd last, all of the nine participants      in the proposed program have indicated that they could not agree to the elimination of the ""most favorea -nation"" Provision in paragraph 4 of the August 1, 1967 letter proposal. It was my under-standing that Mr. Beck would review our discussion and would write me a letter outlining the specific objections he had on this point.                In your letter you submit your view that it is unfair to lmpose a restriction ""which would make it virtually impossiblc for Chemical Research to negotiate at arms length with any one of the Companies that might be anxlous to use the proeess."" I trust that we are in agreement as to the meaning of the clause under consideration. It would not, upon acceptancc of the proposal, preclude Chemical from negotiating with any cigarette manufacturer during the course of the testing or at any time thereafter. . It in no way requlres relinquishment"

It is simply an undertaking that you will accord to every applying cigarette manufacturer, whether or not :a participant ln the program, terms and condltions as favorable as those you have previously given or may thsreafter give to any other Cigarette Company. If during the course of the testlng program, which I am sure you will understand will be a costly undertaking for the participating Companies, you are to offer to one of them a particular deal, anothor Company who would thereafter desire to avail itself of the proeess' would expect to get the same terms and conditions. In my view, the Provision would not only prornote the wider use of the proeess if the Claims for it were confirmed —- by that independent evaluation and in this sense would in no way be a restraint upon your negotiations.               In addition, in our meeting on February 23rd, Mr. Beck undertook to canvass with Dr. Hudson the re-quest made for the data supporting Appendix IX in his latest Blue Book and the ambiguities concerning the Suggestion that Dr. Hudson or one of his representatives ""be present at all times to see that everything is done properly."" I. assume that neither you nor he has had an *""opportunity as yet to clarify that point.               In keeping with my desire to move this project along, I communicated the discussions on February 23rd to each of the partlcipants. I am hopeful that you can reconsider your position on paragraph 4 of the letter "" of August 1, 1967, or amplify your objections to it possibly leading to clarification of the provision if .... that seems necessary. Just as soon as X hear from you about clarification of the point about Appendix IX and the insistence in Mr. Beck's letter of January 15, 1968 that Dr. Hudson be constantly present during the independent evaluation, I will promptly send these mate-rlals to all of the partlcipants. If that can be ac-companied by some further word from you about paragraph 4, I believe it will contribute to expedlting consideration.                                  Sincerely yours,"

American Tobacco Company is a substantial competitor and unless the FTC has already given the report to American it does not possess it. The Roper Study was privately funded and undertaken for a private business function. Your release will benefit our competitors who do not have it and will benefit other business adversaries of Brown & Williamson. We protest your release of a study obtained under compulsory process ln a non-public Investigation. Brown & Williamson has already addressed a motion to Judge Barrington Parker relating to the Roper Study and related issues of confidentiality and you are hereby lnformed that if you release the Roper Study before we have had an opportunity for a hearing on this matter we will press for appropriate judicial sanction. There is no urgency in disclosing the Roper Study or Information contalned in it and you surely can wait until the court has ruled. Very truly yours, Ernest Pepples /dlb"

Homburger Bio-Research Institute Cambridge, Massachusetts 02141  Dear Dr. Homburger:       The ICR mice arrived from ARS/Sprague-Dawley and we had the tissues tested for gs antigen by Dr. Huebner's laboratory and the sera of the retired breeders tested for their viral antibody spec-trum by Dr. Parker at Microbiologica1 Associates, Inc.       The sera were all negative for PVM, Reo 3, GS VII, K, Polyoma, KRV, H-I, SVc, M.Ad, LCM and Vaccinia. Seven                           of the eleven mice  showed HAI titers of 1:10 to 1:40              for        Sendi.       Nine of the eleven mice  showed titers of 1:80 to 1:640 for MVM. Three of the eleven mice gave 1:10 to 1:20 CF titers for MHV.       The gs antigen CF results are presented in the attached table.  It would appear that these mice are very switched-on for gs antigen even as weanlings. This makes it very difficult to evaluate any effects that Chemical carcinogens       may                    have on the spieen, thymus  or liver tissues although studies       for the presence of gs antigen   in  the tumors could still be done. A mouse strain showing less gs antigen would serve our purpose better for some future studies. Sincerely yours, Carrie E. Whitmire, Ph.D. Project Director cc: Dr. J. Kreisherv^      Dr. R.J.

I am pleased to enclose a Statement describing policies of The Council and a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported. Our application procedure entails a mandatory two-step process. First, a short oreliminarv inauirv is sent to members of the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluate it for scientific merit and for ""fit"" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. If the Committee’s review vote is positive, you will be provided with forms and instructions for completing a full aoolication. In the event you receive an award, The Council will consider up to two annual renewals on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications.        The Council operates two application cycles per year and accepts oreliminarv inauiries year-round; the date of receipt by CTR determines the cycle in which the proposal is evaluated. Spring cycle - any inquiry received between March 16 and September 15 and encouraged by the Executive Committee may be submitted as a full application by November 30.       Fall cycle - inquiries received between September 16 and March 15 and encouraged by the Committee may be submitted as full applications by May 31:  Cycle Preliminary Inquiry   Deadline for   Notification Activation         Arrival at CTR      Full Application     Date     Date        Spring Mar 16 - Sep 15          Nov 30      Early May    Jul 1         Fall Sep 16 - Mar 15          May 31      Early Oct    Jan 1       The format for the preliminary application is as follows: 1. A three page narrative summary. This should contain a synopsis of the proposed project including relevant background material, its present Status and goals, a brief outline of the research and its impact. The summary should end with a sentence indicating the anticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate of the anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three page limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature citations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the proposal, they must be accommodated within the three page limitation. 2. Two page curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal Professional level collaborators (the NIH format is quite acceptable). Again, the page limit is strictly enforced; only two pages per investigator are forwarded to the Committee. 3. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought.                                                                                              !

On page 59, the electric racing set4 ""Grand Prix Formula 1 Racing"" shows a picture of the world Champion McLaren-Honda racing car which contains several depictions of our Red Roof Design, including on the nose of the race car in front of the driver's cockpit, on the driver's helmet, and on the engine cowl directly behind the driver. Also, the unauthorized uses appear on the toy car itself that is part of the racing set.        The McLaren-Honda electric racing car Model No. 8970 that is shown on page 70 bears several unauthorized uses of our MARLBORO Red Roof Design and it also shows multiple unauthorized usages of the MARLBORO (word) trademark.        We also note that on page 138 the Video Driver Software entitled Road Adventure III Road Race No. 1282 distributed under license from Sega Enterprises Ltd. shows several unauthorized uses of the MARLBORO Red Roof Design. 2062098910"

Moreover, while cigarettes are our major product, substantial business is done in several areas and, as you may also be aware, MARLBORO Sponsors several race cars, racing teams and automobile racing events around the world. Among the racing cars and racing teams sponsored are the MARLBORO McLaren racing team and the current CART-Indy car Champion.       MARLBORO, the MARLBORO Red Roof Design and the combination thereof are all trademarks owned by Philip Morris. Accordingly, the usage of our trademarks, trade dress and words and designs confusingly similar therewith infringe our rights under federal, state and common law.       Further, smoking is an adult decision, and all of our cigarette advertising and promotion are directed at informed adult smokers. Your Company's mentioned products would appear to be intended primarily for children and the use thereon of our trademarks and trade dress is therefore contrary to our advertising and promotion policies.       Notwithstanding the foregoing, we would likely be amenable to resolving this matter on an amicable basis and without resort to litigation, on the following conditions:       (a) Provide us with the names and addresses of any manufacturer or supplier of the mentioned products, if other than your Company;       (b) Undertake to cease all further manufacture, sale and distribution of the mentioned products after the exhaustion of your current stock on hand.                         o                                                                         o-.                                                                         ro                                                                         o       I look forward to hearing from you promptly, in the hopes oa that this matter may be expeditiously resolved.

The Formula Committee at its meeting on June 12, 1947, directed us to increase the auantity of glycerine in Cigarette and smoking tobacco formulas. Also, to add a hygroscopic agent to plug tobacco so that it will keep in a more pliable condition. It is our understanding the amount of glycerine in these formulas • should be increased gradually, the first increase to become ef-fective the early part of August when our stock of Humectose will be used up. Since Humectose contains approximately 70# sugar, it is desirable to add cane sugar to the formulas in which Humectose is taken out. Therefore, we propose the following changes in our formulas to become effective as soon as our present stock of Humectose is exhausted, which will be in the next few days:(        Cigarettes:    Increase  glycerine from 1to 2#.                      Increase raw sugar from 100# to 125#* ?   P. A.       :  Increase glycerine     from  20# to 50#.

After arrangements had    been made to störe 500 gallons    of concentrated extract at the product end of No. 4 Dryer, a 2.3 hr. run was made on June 15 vlth concentrated extract applied to sprays at both ends of No. 4 Dryer. The extract used at the feed end was about 5-6 per cent stronger and that at the product end about 2 per cent stronger than that normally used. With these strengths the dryer speed was increased to 340 ft./min. from its normal 280-290 ft./min. and a sheet of satisfactory flavor and moisture content was made. No operating difficulties were experienced. One 600-lb. can of diced product from No. 4 Dryer was separated and saved to determine if the test product tended to laminate. The can saved from the test run when using concentrated extract only on the product end last week was too dry, about 11.5% moisture, to prove if using the concentrated extract in this manner would cause lamination."

As you know, Scction 19 of the New Mexico FPA limits the OP Ms“ reimbursement Obligation to actual “costs and expenses” that, among other things, (a) are “reasonable,” and (b) were incurred “in connection with” the Action, e., State of New Mexico v. The American Tobacco Co., et al. The OPMs have the express right to conduct a “full audit” of a Cost Statement that they dispute, FPA § 19(b) (emphasis added), and that right plainly includes the right to such Information and documentation as would tend to establish or disprove the reimbursability of particular expenses in light of the aforementioned critcria,                Your letter of June 25 implicitly acknowledges the Branch Law Firm's possession of the time records and cost and expense repotts requested by our auditors. These records and         Oo reports are obviously essential components of the OPMs’ full audit, and relate directly to, for example, whether particular expenses were actually incurred, whether the amounts claimed            <j-,                                                                                                                       CD                                                                                                      o                                                                                                      CO                                                                                                                       NO"

Although we will go forward with the initial visit to your firm by our auditors that is scheduled to commence on July 13, you should know that your continued refusal to provide the requested documentation will constitute a material breach of the FPA, and will preclude the OPMs’ completion of the full audit of your firm’s costs and expenses (the completion of which is itself a prerequisite to any arbitration of this matter). Accordingly, 1 urge you to reconsider your Position. In any event, the OPMs reserve all of their rights under the FPA and the Master Settlement Agreement.       cc:       Elizabeth  C.

Ms. Berry, an employee of Circle K Store #1504 (208-734-1582), purchased the pack from Circle K. Because there was allegedly a hole in the outside packaging and filter of the cigarette, a Det. Dennis Chambers of the Twin Falls, Idaho police department (208-736-2219) was notified. The detective contacted the FBI and is holding the sample, without testing, until he receives further instructions from them. Upon FBI approval, the cigarettes will be released to Philip Morris and we will perform an analysis. Our Division Manager in Boise, ID also received a call from Michael Hardin, the GAB adjuster representing Circle K Stores (800-366-4214), requesting Information on the cigarettes; i.e., where manufactured, stamped and how many we re allegedly tampered with. Mr. Hardin was advised that Philip Morris is investigating.

In an effort to identify these tnusk cöraponente as well as to search for a quality supply, commercial musk preparations from Givaudan and Alfred Bader Chemicals were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.                                     >  The mass spectrum (Figure 2) of musk Peak A in Wisconsin cigar smoke matched with those of the two Givaudan ambrettolide PeakTs C and D in Figure 4 (mass spectra in Figures 5 and 6). According to Arctander's Perfune and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, No. 105, Givaudan ambrettolide contains mainly cyclohexadecen-7-olide (1) as 6hown In Figure 7. Judged from our analysis, the possibility of cis-trans Isomers or double-bond shift isomers being present in Givaudan's sample could not be ruled out since nearly identical mass spectra were observed although these two peaks were chromatographically different.  The musk Peak B in Wisconsin cigar smoke (Figure 1), was considered as another isomer of ambrettolide (I), which gave a very similar mass spectrum with some minor differences in the relative intensities of some ions.  ABC's ambrettolide gave yet another possible isomer of ambrettolide (Figure 8) with a similar structure.  Unequivocal Identification of these closely related isomers can be carried out when pure authentic isomers are acquired for GC/mass spectral analyses.  In conclusion, despite the fact that both these ambretolide preparations offered pleasing musk aromas, the Givaudan ambrettolide components seemed to match with the musk components in Wisconsin cigar smoke better than the ABC's ambrettolide.

In order to facilitate  the acquisition  of  an American visa, she will need a letter of Invitation from CTR showing that she is accompanying myself on business.

Bible     President and                                                         November 10. 1995 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER        Mr. Arthur/f: Stevens 1 Park Ajre 18th Fl New Yjfik, NY 10016-5802        DearMr. Stevens:             I am writing to ask for your help in opposing a veiy serious threat to our business — the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) unprecedented and illegal assertion of regulatory control over the cigarette industry.             On its face, the FDA’s action would seem only to affect our Philip Morris U.S.A. tobacco operations. But I can assure you, if the FDA succeeds in its efforts, the effects could be much broader.             As most of you know, in August, FDA Commissioner David Kessler, with President Clinton’s support, asserted jurisdiction over tobacco products and unveiled a plan for FDA regulation. Commissioner Kessler claims that the FDA’s plan is designed to prevent minors from smoking.             I hope that you will agree that tuming back Commissioner Kesslers efforts to regulate our tobacco products is of paramount importance. I also hope that we can count on you to take action by writing to your members of Congress expressing your opinion that FDA regulation of cigarettes is both illegal and unwarranted. You can write to your elected officials at the following addresses:                Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato                   Senator Daniel Moynihan                520 Hart Senate Office Building              464 Russell Senate Office    Building                Washington, DC 20510                         Washington, DC 20510                The Honorable Carolyn B. Maloney Longworth House Office Building Room 1504                Washington, DC 20515             For your convenience, I have provided some writing points, which, if you agree with the message, you can feel free to use in your letters to your legislators.             Philip Morris agrees absolutely that minors should not smoke and should not have access to cigarettes. In fact, in June of this year Philip Morris U.S.A. announced a major new initiative — called Action Against Access — to address the issue of youth access to cigarettes. 91059531"
"Tobacco800";"bfk68c00-page03_2";"NextPage";"p-  4      Through the Action Against Access initiative, Philip Morris U.S.A. is taking several unilateral steps to help prevent minors from having access to cigarettes. Philip Morris U.S.A. no longer provides free cigarette samples, nor do we send cigarettes through the mail. All packs and cartons of our brands produced for sale in the U.S. now carry a notice stating ""Underage Sale Prohibited.1' These packs are now starting to appear at retail. Phüip Monis U.S.A. is funding a major effort to educate retailers about the importance of understanding and enforcing minimum age laws. Also under development is a plan to suspend retail merchandising benefits to retailers who have been fined or convicted of selling cigarettes to minors.      Philip Morris U.SA is also taking a leadership position in supporting reasonable state legislation to further address the issue of youth access to cigarettes.      In total, the Action Against Access initiative represents a heartfelt commitment to address the very serious issue of underage smoking.      However, we believe that the plan announced by PDA Commissioner Kessler goes far beyond the youth smoking issue and that his long-term goal is to severely restrict and ultimately ban the sale of cigarettes to adults. At the very least, the FDA’s plan will unreasonably restrict free Speech and our right to market our products to adult smokers.    Among other things, the FDA’s plan includes the following: • Except in certain ""adult"" publications, cigarette advertising and signage would be limited to a black-and-white, text-only ""tombstone"" format; • A ban on the use of brand names on non-tobacco merchandise, such as caps, T-shirts and lighters; • A ban on self-service displays; and, • A ban on brand sponsorship of musical, cultural and sporting events, such as Marlboro Racing.      ln addition to our concem that the FDA plan would infringe on our abüity to market and seil cigarettes to adults, we also believe that FDA regulation of cigarettes is illegal. Congress, and only Congress, has the authority to change the FDA’s mandate to include regulatory authority over cigarettes. And in the more than 20 times that Congress has specifically been asked to address the issue, Congress has never given the FDA any authority whatsoever over cigarettes."
"Tobacco800";"bfk68c00-page03_3";"NextPage";"/      Philip Morris is so convinced that FDA regulation of cigarettes is illegal, that we joined four other U.S. tobacco Companies, as well as a North Carolina advertising agency, in filing a lawsuit in federal court in North Carolina.      We also believe that FDA regulation of cigarettes would set a very dangerous precedent for future over-regulation of other products of which Commissioner Kessler might not approve. If the agency is allowed regulatory control of cigarettes today, what will be next? A can of beer? A cup of coffee? A chocolate bar? Allowing Commissioner Kessler to expand his regulatory empire in this way will only open the door to more nonsensical regulation.      As we work together to tum back the FDA’s unlawful plan, we must keep in mind that it imperils more than Philip Morris U.S.A. The FDA’s threat is a business issue of paramount importance to all of us in the Philip Morris family of Companies -- and indeed, to all      Working together, I believe we can reduce minors’ access to cigarettes - and help defend our family of Companies from unreasonable regulation.      I want to thank you for taking the time and trouble to read this letter and for making the effort to write to your elected officials.      With best wishes. Americans. Sincerely, Geoffrey C.

V. Ayer & Son Inc.             30 Rockefeiler Plaza New York, New York             Dear Newt:             Last week marked the introduction of the new Philip Morris in the States of California, Oregon and Nevada. We consider it most signifi-cant that we have chosen newspapers as the basic medium to promote this revolutionary packaging of a popular-price cigarette.             Philip Morris Inc. has historically used newspapers to great extent in its promotional efforts. The heavy roles played by newspapers in our ""Changing our Dress"" campaign and in the recent Marlboro schedules are examples of the Import we attach to the medium. There are two primary reasons for this:                        1. The concentration of effort afforded by local media.                        2. The scope of merchandising Services offered by newspapers.             In the past, we have enjoyed outstanding merchandising support from the newspapers selected for the current schedule of large-space insertions. Since this is the first campaign placed for Philip Morris through N.W. Ayer & Son Inc., we strongly recommend that you seek the newspapers* Cooperation and support in this regard.             All of us at Philip Morris will be eager to review the merchandising support accorded us by the newspapers and their efforts will be greatly appreciated. Cordially, to PHILIP MORRIS  MARLBORO  PARLIAMENT 040774501"

This measure, Assembly Bill 7139, seeks to prevent tobacco use by minors b other things, banning all cigarette advertising with the exception of ads that < newspapers or magazines. This proposal is ill-conceived and potentially destructive to my industry, whi thousands of people in New York State. Studies both abroad and in the Uni have determined that cigarette advertising plays a minimal role in an individu to smoke. Peer influence, and the influence of parents and older siblings, is 1 dominant fhctor. Banning advertising, therefore, will not affect the incidenc« by youths. Besides being ill-suited to achieve its stated purpose, this proposal is unconsi Since the 1970's, the courts have ruled that commercial speech is protected i First Amendment. Unfortunately, by the time the courts get around to overt measure, the economic damage will already have been done.to my industry a others.

I am pleased to enclose a Statement describing policies of The Council and a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported. Our application procedure entails a mandatory two-step proeess. First, a short oreliminarv inauirv is sent to members of the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluate it for scientific merit and for ""fit"" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. If the Committee’s review . vote is positive, you will be provided with forms and instructions for completing a full application. In the event you receive an award, The Council will consider up to two annual renewals on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications.         The Council operates two application cycles per year and accepts oreliminarv inouiries year-round; the date of receipt by CTR determines the cycle in which the proposal is evaluated. Spring cycle - any inquiry received between March 16 and September 15 and encouraged by the Executive Committee may be submitted as a full application by November 30.       Fall cycle - inquiries received between September 16 and March 15 and encouraged by the Committee may be submitted as full applications by May 31: Cycle  Preliminary Inquiry   Deadline for   Notification Activation           Arrival at CTR    Full Application     Date        Date     Spring   Mar 16 - Sep 15        Nov 30       Early May     Jul 1     Fall     Sep 16 - Mar 15        May 31       Early Oct     Jan 1     The format for the preliminary application is as follows: 1. A three page narrative summary. This should contain a synopsis of the proposed project including relevant background material, its present Status and goals, a brief outline of the research and its impact. The summary should end with a sentence indicating the anticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate of the anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three page limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature citations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the proposal, they must be accommodated within the three page limitation. 2. Two page curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and prineipal Professional level collaborators (the NIH format is quite acceptable). Again, the page limit is strictly enforced; only two pages per investigator are forwarded to the Committee. 3. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought.

Gourley                 At the request of Mr. Alejandro Arteta, Fabrica de Cigarrillos, El Progreso S.A.; Mr. W. A. Goodson, Winston Leaf submitted three types       of flue-cured            tobaccos for quality evaluation, by Tobacco Development.                 It was our understanding they were to be investigated as Supplements for the AO-1 Argentine flue-cured blend presently utilized in their King, Commander, and possibly the mild charcoal filter blends. Based on this assumption they were smoked individually against the Argentine flue-cured by the International Expert Panel. In their opinion grade AFD-SFD (R.J.R.-3) was equivalent to AO-1 in flavor and aroma while AF4S (R.J.R.-3) had similar characteristics, but less overall flavor. However, they feit both could be utilized as Supplements to AO-1 but not as a total replacement. The JDS (R.J.R.-6)        was rejected com-            pletely due to the low flue-cured flavor and aroma.                 The R.J.R. grades were assigned by Mr. John Hutcheson and the only reason JDS was graded 6 was based on color and texture. Further evaluations were carried out by Mr. Hutcheson under TL-452.

The same news report was also supplied by Dr. Koller on Sept 12, 1997. In response to the above, I requested a Japanese media article search on “Sick Building Syndrome"" by an outside Company, and at the same time I executed an Internet search. As the results, media articles describing the following projects initiated by the Japanese Government were obtalned: (1) the above project, initiated by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), (2) a joint project by the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW), the MITI, and the Forestry Agency, and (3) a project by the MHW. For summary translations of media articles regarding (1) and (2), see attachment No. 2. Regarding (3), see attachment No. 3, which is the summary translation of a report from the subcommittee obtained via the Internet.

On January 16, the Times reported on a study by a Japanese scientist, Takeshi Hirayama, who claimed that wives of heavy *. smokers had a higher risk of dying from lung cancer because t of their husband's Smoking. That news report, based .on an • article recently published in the British Medical Journal, was followed by    a  January 21 editorial, ""Smoking    Your Wife  to Death."" , -    - ' ,'V.  Unfortunately,    it  appears neither  your reporter,   nor editorial   :  writer, took the time to carefully analyze the report.            :  Serious questions can be raised about Hirayama's analysis of . his own data. For example, in his study, he placed both non- ■ smokers and occasional smokers in the same group. He also grouped ex-smokers with daily smokers of up to 19 cigarettes.  If the apparent purpose of the study was to compare wives exposed . to their husbands* smoking with those not exposed, why did he mix the groups?               ■.«            ;           . • .   ■  ' .    .  Although the husbands* smoking habits were considered, the Hirayama study made no attempt to determine the times, if.any, when the husbands smoked with their wives present. Such information is             1,  critical for a scientific discussion of the wives*. exposure to ‘j‘ their husbands' tobacco smoke.                           .                         •.  The validity of    the Hirayama        data    is also open to challenge. The  study relied on death certificates for ""cause of death"" information although it is a well-established fact that lung cancer is often misdiagnosed on death certificates. Apparently, no attempt was made to verify the death certificate information. 03021035  Nor is there any indication that Hirayama considered any ""unusual"" environmental exposures which may affect lung cancer .rates.               ."

Worrell                          Evaluation:    CIM,  1977, No.  11                                         LOW SIDESTREAM PRODUCT. Freddie W. Best                The experiments upon which CIM, 1977, No. 11 was based were exploratory and are described in RDM, 1972, No. 20. The results obtained in the labora-tory indicate that whole tobacco and stems can be ground, extracted, homogenized, molded, dried, and cast into a rigid, smokable rod with acceptable taste, weights and pressure drops. Preliminary smoke analyses of handmade (Laredo filter cigarette maker) cigarettes show a 25-42% reduction in FTC ""tar"" compared to WINSTON.          The cast rod smolders slowly with concomitant increase in puff number and appears, from visual inspection, to give a low sidestream smoke which is very attractive from the ""social aspects of smoking"" viewpoint.                The processes used to produce this cigarette are all straightforward pro-cedures in the laboratory. Producing the cigarette on a commercial scale would necessitate development of new manufacturing techniques. The Steps involved are (on a laboratory scale):                1) Medium-grade tobacco and stems are ground to a 16 to 20-mesh.                2) The ground tobacco is extracted with hot water or water and methanol.                3) The extract is concentrated and the tobacco reconstituted with the                      extrace serving as a binder.                4) Rods are molded from the reconstituted slurry, dried, and reequilibrated                      to 60% humidity.                5) Cigarettes are made on a hand cigarette maker and tipped.          Most of the steps could be easily adapted from existing methods used in the factory. The molding of the rods into cigarettes would require new manufacturing processes.                The processes of concentrating the extract and drying the swollen tobacco rods are energy expensive. Changes in manufacturing techniques would be needed to produce the cigarette on a commercial scale. There are losses in grinding and handling which would have to be minimized.                These expenses could be offset by the following features:                1)  The method produces a rod of swollen tobacco which might reduce       the          ^                      need for tobacco expanded by other means, e.g., Freon 11.                        o                2)  The higher puff number may make a shorter tobacco rod feasible.                    0                3)  Medium grade tobacco (44X) makes a better product than high grade                  *                      tobacco (SFX).                                                                   J                4)  Burley stems improve the product.                                                  ®             BJBi FOBM                 7/70"

Dear Doctor Hockett:             Safely back in Winnipeg where we are shivering in -20° weather, I wish to thank you for inviting me to the Conference On the macrophage. Taken as a vhole 1 thought the confeTence was valuable although I must admit to some synaptic overload during the first part of the Friday morning session.             As I left ybu asked for comments, so perhaps 1 may pinpoint the particular areas that impressed me.             On the first day, the Work of Joseph Guarneri continues to impress me; here is a wealth and depth of knowledge and the combinatipn of in-vivo and vitro modele has much to offer in the elucidatibn of disturbed macrophagic function.    It becarne clear, as the dlscussion progressed, that there are significant gaps in our knowledge about bactericidal mechanisms in the lung. Is it related solely to the macrophage or are uther factors such as surfactant involved too?             The two papers oh scanning electron microscopy were fascinating and, of course, very beautifully prcsented. 1 Chink it was interesting to sce the surface changes in Che adapted or angry imacrophages but the long ränge sigrtificance of this is doubtful. S.E.M. may perhaps, hecause of its low magnificaticn, be of some use in quantitative studies, but I dbn't see it as a tnajor invescigativc tool.             Afcer lunch on Thursday, the papers of Cross and Mustafa emphasiaed an important parameter, the metabolic adaptive changes that occur vhcn the macrophage is irritated in any way. It is important to look at the macrophage in this vay since it is becoming apparent that the adaptive capacity of the macrophage is great and only when this capacity is cxcccded may t*c cxpect trcuble."

You have my assurance that we will address the Blue Cross Stipulation of Dismissal with you next week in an attempt to resolve outstanding issues with respect to such a Stipulation.            I have told you that at least in the case of Philip Morris, Philip Morris will be producing some of the materials required by Section XV.A.4, of the Settlement Agreement this coming Monday, but that complete production cannot be made before June 30. I understand that you will address our need for a further extension of time to complete production after we have discussed the Blue Cross Stipulation.   OQ   OU   CO   ro   TO   0*1   Os   Sl"

It would appear that they are working toward two inhala-tion test Systems — Dr. Auerbach's dog System and a System under development by Dr. Saffiotti in collaboration with Oak RIdge for the forced Smoking of hamsters using a tracheal tube. These test Systems would be used to make Inhalation tests on those cigarettes chosen on the basis of the painting experiments            now         in progress at Melpar for the selection        of a ""safe"" cigarette.       Attached are copies       of the three contracts  now  in progress under the direction of the NCI        Tobacco Working Group,     If   further Infor- mation is needed please feel free to contact me.

To gradually increase the quantity of glycerine in cigarette and smoking tobacco formulas to that of pre-war formulas.-       2. To continue the use of propylene glycol for its anti-mold value in addition to its value as a softening agent for tobacco^       3. To discontinue Humectose. ^       4.

A study was made to ascertain what chemical effects could be associated with the inclusion of water, The routine method for the multicomponent analysis of the gas phase of smoke was used in the comparative studies (B&W Report 68-15). The additional water in the charcoal filter may impart more water to the smoke, but this effect was not determined in the present Study.  A quantity of 20 x 50 mesh BEL carbon was dried for 3 hours at 150°C. One-half of the dried -carbon was sprayed with water to contain 26% included water, Cigarettes were constructed with the wet carbon on the 323007 cigarette (8 1/2 CA-8C-8 1/2 CA, CA ■= 3,9/40 acetate) and allcwed to condition overnight in a room at 60% RH and 75 F. The dried carbon was not inserted into the cigarettes until the time o£ smoking; the tobacco sections, however, were conditioned overnight as with the other cigarettes. The 84 mm cigarettes were smoked to a 33 mm butt length on a mcdified BAT Bellows Smoking Machine.  Deliveries and filtration efficiencies are tabulated in Table I. The rat io of wet/dry deliveries by compound type are shown in Table II,  Discussion  The Overall efficiency of the dry carbon, 787, for the compounds listed from propylene through toluene, is reduced by water treatment of the charcoal to 64%.  The change in smoking quality associated with water treatment does not, however, lie merely in Overall efficiency reduotion, since lesser amounts of dry carbon still have poor taste, The difference must lie in relative chemical compositions.  The largest change is the ratio of wet/dry deliveries of satugated and^unsat-urated hydrocarbons having boiling points ranging between -48 C and 34 C which is of the order of 2/1. Hydrocarbons in this boiling ränge do have character-istic aromas and tastes although these compounds have not usually been considered as contributors to smoking quality. The wet/dry ratlos for the other classes of components lie between 1.2 and 1.5. Surprisingly, no differences are observed between rates for the hydrophilic carbonyl compounds and the hydrophobic aromatic hydrocarbons.  The above experiment has not tlirown much light on how water reduces ""charcoal taste."" Either greater differences exist for compounds not determined in the GC method or more emphasis should be placed on low molecular weight aliphatic hydrocarbons, The latter seems unlikely.                                      620840103  HWM/dw  KFYWOKT) TNDEX:   Carbon,   Charcoal,                       Gas                  Phase,      Smoke Qua1ity, Fi1tratton  cc:  Dr.  P.

During the last quarter of 1975, Marlboro became the largest selling cigarette in the industry, and is now the Number One Brand both in the United States and around the world. Reaching number one has been a long but most rewarding pro-cess, and is the result of much hard work on the part of many people here at Philip Morris. We recognize, however, that we would not have been able to reach this goal without the continued Cooperation of you and your people. As a token of our appreciation for your ongoing support and contribution to Marlboro1 s success, enclosed is a specially commissioned plate engraved with Charles M. Russell's sketch, ""Corozon Reared Straight Up. "" Russell's work represents the very best in frontier art, and makes an en-during comment about life in the Old West. We realize that in order to maintain Marlboro's leadership position and growth momentum, we must continue to rely on you for the kind of support we've received for the brand over the past 20 years. 204415946"

My expenses associated with the trip are small; one requires explanation and it may not be allowable. The plane from Minneapolis left for San Juan at 07.30; this meant travelling from Winnipeg the previous evening and taking an hotel near the airport. I have enclosed the bill for this expenditure.

Bethesda, MD 20816 Dear Ray: We have received your letter with the photocopied pages de-scribing a non-parametric multiple comparison test. This test is similar to one described in Zar's Biostatistical Analysis (1984), but Zar's descriptions and explanations for the use of this and other tests appear more thorough and comprehensive. I have enclosed his chapter on ""Multiple Comparisons"" and several tables required to determine the significance of the testedi data. Over the past two months we have been reviewing the Statistical procedures used in our studies and are requiring all of our laboratories to implement changes in statistics where needed. Several involve the use of the multiple comparison procedures enclosed. Franklin and' I have just completed a review of the Statistical tests employed in the Six-Week Inhalation Study and have the following comments: (1) We feel that a post hoc procedure other than multiple Mann-Whitney U-tests would be more appropriate after statistically significant Kruskal-Wallis tests. The chapter fromi Zar (1984) describes a Tukey-type nonparametric multiple comparison test which appears very similar to the one you recently sent us. Zar also describes alternative tests which are used when sample sizes are equal or if tied' ranks are present. We can discuss which test we will use after you have looked them over. (2) Because percent carboxyhemogilobin measurements are part of               / the criteria for determination of a valid test, it is important only to demonstrate that each' individual smoke-exposed group exhibits statistically greater percent COHb values compared to the sham grou£. ; In other words, a non-parametric multiple treatment vs. one control test is required. Zar describes a non-parametric equivalent of Dunnett1s Test (p.201) which can be used for this purpose. We have a Computer program (Fortran) which can perform this test if it is compatible with your system. 80193086"
"Tobacco800";"cnk41e00-page02_2";"NextPage";"■f (3)  The validity of Analysis of Variance rests on several key       assumptions including: homogeneity of variance and normality. We were wondering if your Statistical programs test the data for these assumptions before the ANOVA is carried out? If not, perhaps a test for homogeneity of variance and a test for normality on all data that are to be tested with ANOVA is in order. Some parameters (e.g. enzyme concentrations), currently being tested by Kruskal- Wallis, may be more appropriately tested by ANOVA unless you have historical data which indicates that these are more appropriately handled by non-parametric statistics. We can discuss the Statistical treatment of these parameters at a later time. We are in the process of reviewing the statistics used in other studies under your direction. We will be contacting you soon to discuss our conclusions as well as changes to be made in the analysis of the ""Six-Week"" studies. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to call.                                                                                                                                                                        ,1 Thomas A.

FcyRl-associated FceRIy is a disulfide-linked homodimer         In our preliminary data, we demonstrated that a c. 14 kD protein is co-precipitated with FcyRI by anti-FcyRI mAb 197 from digitonin lysates of 125I-labeled THP-1 cells. This protein co-migrated with FceRIy and was recognized by an anti-FceRIy mAb, 4D8. We have since performed two-dimensional nonreducing-reducing gel electrophoresis on mAb 197 and mAb 4D8 immunoprecipitates from THP-1 cells. As shown in Figure 1, both mAb precipitate a spot (indicated by arrow) migrating below the diagonal, indicating a disufide-linked homodimer. This result provides further confirmation of the identity of the 14 kD FcyRI-associated protein and FceRIy. The role of FceRIy homodimer formation in FcyRI signaling will be further addressed in mutational studies, as detailed in the proposal.  3 &  *  ■i  i anti-Fc^RI anti-FceKI* Figure 1.

Hyperpkosphorylation ofthe src kinase hck induced by FcyRI engagement         To assay for src kinase activation following FcyRI engagement, we used a panel of rabbit anti-peptide antisera generated in our laboratory that react specifically with different src family protein tyrosine kinases, including hck.fgr, lyn, and src, all of which are expressed in monocytes. We made use of a sensitive in-situ kinase assay to detect autophosphorylation of src PTK, which accompanies their activation. THP-1 cells were stimulated with anti-FcyRI mAb 197, then permeabilized with cx-lysophosphatidylcholine and incubated on ice in the presence of 32P-y-ATP. Cells were then subjected to detergent lysis and immunoprecipitation with the different anti-src antisera. As shown in Figure 2, we detected an increase in phosphorylation in hck in THP-1 cells within 30 seconds of Stimulation by anti-FcyRI mAb. In contrast, we did not detect increases in phosphorylation of other src PTK (not shown). These results suggest that activation of the PTK hck is coupled to FcyRI engagement. We are currently evaluating the physical association of src kinases with FcyRI. Our preliminary data suggest that hck and lyn are present in anti-FcyRI immunoprecipitates from THP-1 cells and peripheral blood monocytes, as detected by immunoblotting.

M.W. markers (right hand lane) are at 92,69 and 46 kDa. Four other experiments gave similar results.         I trust that this information will be helpful to the reviewers of the application. 0 20""4<r 1' 2' 5' Sincerely yours;"

However, in the interest of giving you as much time as possible with the document we are mailing this out to you tonight so that you can have it on Thursday. Tomorrow we fwill prepare a marked-up copy of the previous agreement to show where changes have ) been made. We will drop this off at your hotel tomorrow afternoon so that you ^ | caji have it to review prior to our meeting on Friday morning.       s' we discussed, I will pick you up on Friday morning at 8:00 a.m. at the front door of the Pfister. If for any reason you need to contact me on Thursday evening, my home phone is 414-351-4369.      If you arrive in Milwaukee in time for dinner Thursday evening, I suggest you try either the English Room at the Pfister or Karl Ratzsch's (excellent German food), which is just a one-half block walk from the hotel. ours,                                            Jeffrey L.

Washington, D.C. 20071 Dear Mr. Bradlee: In the Post's November 24 article, ""Increased Limit-ations Urged on 'Pushing' Use of Tobacco,"" Dr. William Pollin of the National Institute of Drug Abuse asserted tobacco is ""a powerfully addictive drug."" It is clear that this was a political Statement and that Dr. Pollin' s intent is to create a public impression that cigarette smoking is somehow similar to hard drug use. The ""addiction"" label is taxed, however, when the Surgeon General reports that 33 million Americans have given up smoking, and 95 percent of them have döne so on their own and without outside help. The term ""addiction"" is misused regulärly these days and consequently has lost its true scientific meaning. The Surgeon General, for example, has even claimed that youngsters can become ""addicted"" to video games. The scientific literature clearly shows there is an ongoing curiosity among scientists about the reasons why people smoke. It seems apparent that the decision-making processes involved in whether, when and where an individual smokes are highly complex and, as yet, little understood. Some scientists have termed smoking an ""overlearned"" behavior, similar in many ways to drinking coffee. In short, -cigarette smoking should not be termed an addiction.                                                                       &                                                                       cr>"

The proposal ln this letter has been developed following the visit of the several tobacco Company research scientists to the laboratory of the High Tor Foundation, Inc., on July 20, 1967*            WhIle it is the position of these Companies that there is no scientifically established relation-ship between the testing of mlee (and in particular by the subcutaneous lnjectlon of condensates In mlce), and smoking and health, or any scientifically demon-strated significance In the results of animal testing as related to human smoking, they believe that It would be useful promptly to develop and carry out a program for an Independent and extensive scientific testing of the ""Chemosol"" composition and the proeess utillaing It for addition to cigarette tobacco, ln-cludlng the replIcation of the work of Dr. Perry V. Hudson and his colieagues."

We are therefore proposing the following specific program to protect whatever Interests the Chemical Research and Development Corporation, Dr. Hudson, or others associated with you may have, as well as the Interests of the public and the industry.            1. The Hazleton Laboratories of Falls Church, Virginia, an independent scientific testing agency of acknowledged competence and repute, is to be employed as the testing agency. An adequate proto-col covering testing methodology, sample size, the use of control cigarettes, the determination of any potential toxicity, and any organoleptic testing to be ln-cluded will be prepared by the scientific research representatives of the participating cigarette manu-facturing Companies.            2. The Chemical Research and Development Corporation would undertake, upon receivlng adequate assurance against any disclosure of any confidential information as to the composition or charaeter of the ""Chemosol"" fuel additive, to furnlsh all necessary quantities of ""Chemosol"" for the preparation of test cigarettes. The cigarette manufacturing Companies will, in turn, undertake to assist ln making available the most modern developed cigarette smoking machlnes and other needed testing equlpment.            3. The participating Companies will pay and share, in accordance with a formula to be deter-mined among themselves, the full costs of the testing program. The contract with Hazleton Laboratories is to be with the participating cigarette manufacturing Companies."

C, Tao, Plant Fhysiologist Tobacco Quality Investigations Crops Research Division Agricultural Research Service U, S, Department of Agriculture Bcltsville, Maryland Dear Dr. Tso:            We havc reccivcd your letter of September 30j 19^ > coneerning ""Federal-State health oriented research programs on tobacco"". In particulor you raise the question as to what Chemical components in tobacco1 ""are considered to be potentially health hazardous and sbould be studied"",            I am sure you realize, particul&rly after the Lcxington Kentucky Conference, that in the present state of knovrledge it is really impossible to compile any such list of ""potentially hazardous components"" of tobacco. The reason, of course, is that the presumed dangers of cigarette smoking are conjectural in nature, being inferred largely from. etatistical relationships by mefhods that are still under question and challenge by many of our leading statisticians. There is no disease whose rclationship to cigarette smoking as a significant causal or contributory factor has been convincingly demonstrated by clinical or experimental mefhods. Still less has any contributory mechanism been traccd out in detail or shovm to be due to .any specific ingredient of cigarette smoke.            This certai.nly does not me an that it is impossible to do useful analytical work- by way of stock-piling knovrledge that raay eventually become important. It must, hovrever, be realized, as someone pointed out in Lcxirigton, that such studies can oniy be based upon ""limited working hypotheses"" or ""specülative presurnptions"" that my prove to have no foundation. As.was said there ""opportun iti e s to waste time on futile lcaös are enormous"". Fortunately the by-products of scientific work so often become more important than the original go&ls that good scientific effort is not likely to be wasted i.n the long run, On this clearly defined basis we would approve competent efforts to accumulate new knovlodge of the comp Oriente of the tobacco plant as affected by strain differencG, soll components, weather conditions, genetic factors, fcrtilizers, insecticides, plant diseases, curing methods, ageing etc."

Department of Agriculture and jnany state experiment stations.            In its own program of research, the Council is mainly biologically oriented. Its apprcach, in general, is first to study the effects of whole, normal.cigarette smoke, in as nearly as possible the condition in which human smokers encounter it, on various biological systems. Second, vrhen effects are found that may be potenti&Uy related to h^alth or disease, the plan is to evalu&te such effects in the total physiological economy of the animal and then, finally, to trace any signifieant and undcsireable effects, if possible, to the specific ingrediente of the emoke that cause them. At this point, vhen and if reached, ve would have a satiefaetory basis and incentive for looking into the origins of such a component frorn the constituents of the tobacco it&elf during the combustion process.            At present wc are still engaged almost vrholly in studiee v/ithin the first tvro of the thre.e phase s stated above.            Although our program has many rarräfications, as perusal of our latest Anmal Report (copy enclosed) will shov, wo can illustrate our approach further by reference to stüdies on carcinogenesis.            In this area also, we fccl that it is actually whole, normal cigarette smoke in the form and condition in vhich it is encountercd by humans, that really needs to be tested for any activity it may conceivably havc as a direct contact carcinogcn or eocarcinogen* Studier, of condensates are far less satiefaetory sincc the opportunity for ehanges in Chemical composition and physical properties that occurs on condensation and preservation may be very signifieant. Wiera it has seemed necessary to use such condensates as a temporäry expediert, ve have defined and coritrolled the methods of production and preservation-vdth great care in order to make the&e products at least reproducible.            A large nun!er of bioassay systems have been devised and tested, mostly vith such condensates, in the hope of producing a quick and rcliablc assay method of the kir.d for ‘vtiich great nced was expressed in Lexington, No system has yet been shovn to be vholly satisfactory, though one or two still look somewhat hopeful. Other possible methods need to be studied and, vherc promising, eompared vith and cvaluated in reletion to those already in use, The Council is vitally interested in this type of research,            The experience vrith such assays as have been studied does not support the assumption that polynuclcar hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke are playing any significant role in human lung caneer genesis or indeed"

Hcnce we have not feit that major efforts to reduce further the infinitesimal, levels of polynuelear hydrocarbons in srnoke were l.ikcly to be productive of any real benefits. If others, however, vish to try removing, diminishing or neutralising the possibl.e effects of such substences on thebasis of what they believe to be justifiable assumptions,1 and provided that any nodifications proposed can be shown clearly to produce no other change potentially del.eterious to health, we coul.d not disapprove. At present the limitations of our bioassay methods raake such assurance difficult. We coul.d give other illustrations in aödition to this discussion of possible carcinogenicity, such, for exumplc as ciliostasis, but the general perspective is much the same.            You will be abl.e to apply the general statements that we have niade, to the specific eases of the ccoiponents suggested in your list as cartdiüates for analytieal. study in tobacco leaf samples. We would. applaud the Requisition of Information on all these ingredieots as ndditions to the stock-pile of knowledge that should eventually be useful in one manner or another. but there is no possible assurance at present that any of thcsc will ever turn out to be significantly related to health problems.            In the special case of additives to cigarette tobacco, we have feit that these were quite unlikely to bear ahy rclation to the health picture. The rcason for this feeling is that no such additives are usod in Britain vhere the incidencc of diseases held to be related statistically to cigarette smoking is, nevertheless, much higher then in the United States.            The Council will be gl.ad to be kept in touch with the pro gram of the U. S. Department of Agricul.lure and the National Cancer Institute by corrcspondence and by personal contact.

Dear Doctor Hockett:               Safely back in Winnipeg where we are shivering in -20° weather, I wish to thank you for inviting me to the Conference on the macrophage. Taken as a whole I thought the Conference was valuable although I must admit to some synaptic overload during the first part of the Friday morning Session.               As I left you asked for comments, so perhaps I may pinpoint the particular areas that impressed me.              —_— --------------  ,     .      1    ""    ! ‘                   :    ™            ~t*-> On the first day, the work of Joseph Guarneri continues to impress me; V t                 ii | m 11 in                               ' here is a wealth and depth of knowledge and the combination of in-vivo and vitro models has much to offer in the elucidation of disturbed macrophagic function. It became clear, as the discussion progressed, that there are significant gaps in our knowledge about bactericidal mechanisms in the lung. Is it related solely to the macrophage or are other factors such as Surfactant involved too?  I              The two papers on scanning electron microscopy were fascinating and* of course, very beautifully presented. I think it was interesting to see the surface changes in the adapted or angry macrophages but the long ränge significance of this is doubtful. S.E.M. may perhaps, because of its low magnification, be of some use in quantitative studies, but I don*t see it as a major Imvestigati^e tool.              After lunch on Thursday, the papers of Cross and. Mustafa emphasized an important parameter, the metabolic adaptive changes that occur when the macrophage is irritated in any way. It is important to look at the macrophage in this way since it is becoming apparent that the adaptive capacity of the macrophage is great and only when this capacity is exceeded may we expect trouble."
"Tobacco800";"dlu7aa00_2";"NextPage";" Dr. R.C. Hockett  - 2  December 5, 1972.               the Friday sessions I was particularly impressed with Jim Travis1 approach to protein chemistry and- the utilization of his meticulous techniques for the investigation of proteolytic enzymes. Here is a built in quality control for any experiments your other grantees may conduct in this difficult field. The work he is doing is basic and of high quality.           ln the final paper, Shirley Kaufman demonstrated once again her sound grasp of the cytodynamics of the lung. She has developed a reliable and repro-ducible model for cellular quantitation; now she has to decide what definitive experiments can be built arouud this precise model.           These are hurried and somewhat extemporaneous comments but if I don*t write them down and mail them to you today, chances are that you111 never have any comments at all!

Please indicate where this footnote belongs, or remove the footnote notation if an outlier was not present. SN38LOR (A8lf Page 5, Section IIA, line 2:      Please correct the spelling of August.

Page 9, Section III, Results and Discussion:          The  results       section in some areas is difficult to follow. Perhaps this section would read better if it began with a discussion of      . the unexpected mortality caused by the Test Article, fol-lowed by what was observed in the surviving animals. For example:       Figure 1 displays the mortality of mice following treatment with Test Article A90. Due to unexpected Test Article toxicity, all mice in the 2500 mg/kg dose group and 50% of mice in the 1250 mg/kg dose group died within one hour of dosing. Just prior to death the mice experienced hyperkine-tic activity. An autopsy of one mouse in the 1250 mg/kg dose group revealed a lighter than normal liver color with a ^iter texture. Body weights of surviving mice were mea-sured on dosing day 3 and 5 and were not different from vehicle Controls. Table 1, summarizes the results of the"
"Tobacco800";"dmy31e00-page02_2";"NextPage";"      host resistance challenge assay in mice treated for 5 days with compound A90 or vehicle. Prior to Listeria challenge, 12 and 20 mice in the 1250 and 2500 mg/kg dose group died due to Test Article toxicity. However, the Test Article had no significant effect on mortality or mean survival time following Listeria challenge in the surviving animals including those in the 625 mg/kg dose group. Tables 2a and 2b summarize the anti-SRBC PFC response: 2a) body weight, absolute and relative spieen and thymus weights? 2b) PFC/10 viable cells, viable cells/spleen and percent cell viabil-ity. The Test Article had no statistically significant effect on any parameter. Therefore, in general, A90 did not modulate the immune response as measured by the PFC and host resistance assays. 3.    Page 12, Table 2a, Footnote a:     Please remove the number 10       from the sentence and correct the sentence alignment. We have also reviewed SN33LOR (A66), SN34LOR (A91), SN36LOR (A167), SN37LOR (A156), SN39LOR (A194), and SN41L0R (B34). These reports are acceptable to us and can be considered Final Reports.

Dear Dr Stone Re:   Grant   Application # 1955 - Edward Calabrese, Ph.D. Thank you for sending me the above application and enclosures. I apologise for the short delay, but it has taken me some time to go through it thöroughly. X have organised my comments into the areas which I          think are pertinent  to any grant application. I hope that these will help you           reach a decision. (i) Aims of the project The applicant seeks fco confirm and extend the findings published by us in 1984 that there is a possible inherited and metabolic susceptibility to lung-cancer in smokers. They do not propose to deviate significantly from our own study design with the exception of selection of different types of controls and a broader data analysis. (ii) Work which led up to the project A decade of research effort almost exclusively in our own         laboratories has   led to a greater understanding of the genetics of human drug oxidation processes. At least three independent allelomorphic genes have been described* those regulating debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation and carbocisteine Syoxidation - the applicant refers only to the former of these. Over the years, it has been shown that many oxidative pathways are influenced to a greater or lesser degree by the gene which regulates debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation. In addition* there are many pharmaco-kinetic, therapeutic and toxicological sequelae of the polymorphism. Our own biochemical ei^idemiological studies in lung cancer patients and controls form the basis of Calabrese's application. The lack of perception of the relevant litera-ture to date shown by the applicant in my view detracted considerably from his case, There are several miscitations of the literature and in addition Dr Calabrese bas found it necessary to quote directly from our papers rather than paraphrasing them. Most: importantly, none of the work which has led up to the proposed project was carried out by Dr Calabrese and his collaborators.                                            50257729"
"Tobacco800";"drd89c00-page02_2";"NextPage";"18 February 1986 Dr D Stone (iii) Methods to be used I have no real feelings regarding the selection and investigation methods which are described for patients, relatives and Controls* It would not be ethical in most U.K. centres to offer financial inducements. This is referred to as a ""stipend"" in the consent document0 The applicant seeks to measure debrisoquine and 4-hydroxy-debrisoquine in up to 3000 urine specimens and has as yet not developed locally any expertise in this assay* I find this a little disturbing since they also plan to deviate from the established electron-capture assay which has been widely employed in the U.Kd and utilise a flame-ionisation detection method. In addition, samples of authentic debrisoquine, 4-hydroxy-debriscquine and the internal Standard are not widely available and I am presently unaware of any approach to obtain them. It is possible that the applicant intends to carry out sorae Chemical synthesis de novo. ^In any caae, I find it flippant that the possib-ility of having a working assay, upon which the project would depend completely, has not yet been better explored by the applicant. The Statistical methodology appears adequate. However, better epidemiologic advice could be taken so that the maximum value co.uld be obtained from such a study, for example lifestyle and dietary questionnaire and family history of disease. (iv) Funding and resources sought I found it hard to interpret sorae of the financial requests, If.1 am not mistaken, the applicant seeks funding for the salaries of 19 workers including himself, running costs and Capital expenditure to the sum total of approximately $302 million over three years. To put this into proper perspective, the study which Dr Calabrese seeks to confirm was carried out by a clinical PhD Student who also did all the laboratory analysis. I would estimate that no more than $70,000 were spent on itQ Conclusion The application is both naive and repetitive, It does not serve to advance our knowledge of cancer cause. It makes no intellectual steps above and beyond our own. published work on the subject. I can only conclude that in some way Dr Calabrese’s unit is under threat and that this application is the best he can produce to underpin its funding, Finally, you should know that the NIH have commissioned a study of debrisoquine hydroxylation in cancer and control patients which began in 1985 and will, amongst other things, answer all the questions posed in this application.

I would like to express once again my appreciation of the generous support for research which I have obtained from the CTR. The discovery of the WW domain, a new signaling module that is implicated in several diseases including; cancer, a genetic form of hypertension known as Liddle Syndrome, Muscular Dystrophy and Alzheimer’s Disease, was made possible because of your original support of a seed project that involved several riskv approaches (for example the anti-idiotypic method to isolate proteins which communicatc with an oncogene product). In addition, in sharp contrast to many other funding agencics, the CTR review panel consisted of top leaders and distinguished scientists.         The news of dissolving The Council for Tobacco Research is sad indeed. On various forums and in different directions 1 voice my strong support for your public health service through cultivation of the innovative biomedical research. I still have hope that the CTR will be revived.

Last April, we sat down with State Attorneys General, dass action plaintiffs’ lawyers and public health representatives in an effort to resolve the numerous issues that have arisen conceming tobacco use in the United States. At that time, we faced significant litigation and regulatory risks to our domestic tobacco business, including a large and growing number of health-care cost recovery actions brought by various State Attorneys General; numerous dass and individual Smoking and health actions; and assertion of regulatory authority by the Food & Drug Administration under a Statute that, if determined by the courts to be applicable to tobacco products, could permit the FDA to alter those products radically or to ban them outright. We did not believe that endless litigation was in the long-term best interests of our stockholders, employees, customers, consumers, and suppliers.                 We believed that, if we could achieve a comprehensive settlement of all of these issues on terms that would give us predictability in our continuing business operations, it would be a better alternative for everyonc. After elevcn wecks of difficult, good-faith negotiations, we reached such an agreement: one that was very hard on the tobacco industry, but that would have permitted the 50 million adult Americans who choose to smoke to continue to do so without the endless debate and recrimination that have surrounded tobacco for decades. Some of the agreemenfs terms were a bitter pill for us. They would have involved our voluntary waiver of certain constitutional rights (including our rights to conduct much of our advertising and marketing), and would have had a material adverse effect on the financial performance of our domestic tobacco business. Nevertheless, they would have provided us with a predictable business environment. The agreement would have required the industry to make very large payments — in perpetuity: $368.5 billion over the first 25 years alone, subject to adjustment to reflect inflation and volume reductions. Comprehensive, sensible FDA regulation would have been specifically defined. And the settlement would have resolved the State Attorneys General lawsuits, placed limitations on our civil liability going forward, and avoidcd the possibility of FDA prohibition of tobacco sales to adults.                 While we were under no illusions that this settlement, which required legislative implementation, would be adopted word for word by the Congress, we had good reason to expect that it would not be totally rewritten in every material respect. The Clinton Administration closely monitored the negotiations leading up to the June 20th settlement. It suggested, and the parties TI3148-9002"
"Tobacco800";"dsj50c00-page04_2";"NextPage";"accepted, resolutions of several of the most sensitive issues, such as the amount of industry monetary payments and the basis on which it would be appropriate to bar pimitive damages claims based on past conduct.         Unfortunately, it has now become clear that the proeess has become wholly politicized. Some political leaders have been more concemed with appearing to be “tough” on tobacco than with the practical policy implications of legislative proposals. Few involved in the political proeess have been willing to say “no” in any way to so-called public health advocates who seek nothing less than the bankrupting of the tobacco industry and the early or eventual Prohibition of tobacco products.         The Bill sponsored recently by Senator John McCain and approved 19-1 by the Senate Commerce Committee is the product of this “proeess.” Although critical aspects of the legislation’s plan would require the industry’s consent, the industry was excluded from discussion both with the Administration about its monetary demands and with Senator McCain and his staff about the drafting of the Bill* The Bill substantially changes the June 2Öth settlement in almost every material respect. In fact, although the Bill calls for the tobacco industry to participate, to waive its constitutional rights, and to pay well over half a trillion dollars in the first 25 years, it does not provide the industry with predictability or any other meaningful benefit. In short, it is not a “settlement” at all, and thus is not something in which we can participate.         The price terms of the Bill are totally unreasonable. The nominal 2 5-year total has been increased to well over one-half a trillion dollars. But this is only part of the story. Among other things: •   Whereas the annual payments under the June 2Öth settlement were all to be adjustable for actual declines in sales volumes, the first six annual payments under the Bill — totaling over $115 billion — are fixed without regard to actual level of sales. No matter how much sales volume declines, and even if the FDA bans or radically alters tobacco products during this period, the industry still would have to pay this huge fixed sum. •       The ostensible “$1.10 per pack” charge portrayed by the Bill’s supporters as being the price of the BilFs payments is simply wrong and misleading. Taking into account realistic estimates of the volume declines that would likely occur (even in the absence of FDA action), the actual amount that the industry would be required to pay would be more on the order of $1.70 per pack or higher. And that is before additional payments of up to $6.5 billion per year for litigation judgments and settlements; uncapped liability for awards of attomeys’ fees to plaintiffs’ attomeys; and — after the first three years — an additional potential $3,5 billion per year in “look-back” penalties (which are now specified to be non-tax-deductible). Under the Bill’s provisions, the total cost per pack to be paid by the industry could thus be more than double the advertised “$1.10 per pack.” •  Further, the increase in retail price to the consumer — taking into account both required and realistic mark-ups at the distribution and retail level, the effect of state and local sales taxes, Mid  2 TI3148-9003"
"Tobacco800";"dsj50c00-page04_3";"NextPage";"    potential increases in excise taxes at the state level — would be far higher still. Respected Wall Street analysts have recently predicted that in the fifth year the increase in the price of cigarettes at retail would exceed $2.50 per pack — a predicted increase based on the mandated annual payments alone without taking into account inflation. This regressive tax would be in excess of $ 1,000 per year for average smokers (the majority of whom eam less than $30,000 annually).         Beyond assessing these extraordinary monetary payments, the Bill would also destroy any possibility of predictability by leaving in place a System of untrammeled tort litigation. The billions of dollars of required payments do not even necessarily result in settlement of the State Attorneys General suits: the States can opt out with no resulting diminution in the industry payments. The Bill also eliminates virtually all of the civil liability limitations of the June 20th settlement applicable to our tobacco business except for an annual cap on liability. But even this civil liability provision in the Bill is a mirage, The Bill calls for the liability cap to be revoked in response to a variety of developments over which we have no or very little control. To give just one example, the cap may be revoked at the discretion of the Secretary of Health and Human Services if one of the arbitrary targets for reduction in underage smoking is missed by more than 20 percentage points and the Secretary determines that underage use of our domestic subsidiary’s brands was “responsible” — not that we or our subsidiary did anything wrong. Let me emphasize that we are committed to discouraging and preventing underage smoking, but we cannot accept a “settlement” in which our purported “benefit” is forfeited if teenagers don’t do what we and society want.         The Bill exacerbates the issue of FDA-decreed Prohibition. Indeed, it would expressly confer that authority: the PDA would be empowered to decree an outright ban on tobacco products, an outright ban on nicotine, or virtually anything eise it wishes to mandate regarding the content of cigarettes that it determines in its discretion to be in the furtherance of “the protection of the public health ” The only practical limit on this virtually unrestrained authority is an exception that would permit both houses of Congress to vote down a complete ban on tobacco products or nicotine within two years of the FDA’s institution of such a ban. Far firom delineating specifically what federal bureaucrats could and could not do, the Bill simply leaves the tobacco industry’s continued business operations to the discretion of an unelected federal agency.         Finally, the Bill purports to introduce prohibitive restrictions and taxes on our international tobacco company’s business. These include: * Global application of the Bill’s severe advertising and promotion restrictions — even if competitors in foreign countries could advertise and promote without restriction — thereby placing American manufacturers at an extreme competitive disadvantage overseas. These advertising and promotion restrictions would apply not only to tobacco products exported from the U.S., but to products manufactured abroad by our foreign subsidiaries as well. • Global application of the domestic requirement that cigarettes be sold only in black and white packaging (except in “adult only” establishments). 3 TI3148-9004"
"Tobacco800";"dsj50c00-page04_4";"NextPage";"• Effectively requiring U.S. manufacturers to adhere to domestic performance Standards mandated by the FDA in their international exports. If the FDA banned or limited nicotine, or limited tar, the ban or limit would also apply to export products — again without regard to what foreign competitors could seil. * Imposition of an arbitrary tax of $1.00 per 1,000 cigarettes on all exports and foreign sales. For example, any one of our international company’s Italian products manufactured and sold only in Italy would be subject to this tax. The Bill’s international provisions would effectively destroy our international company’s ability to compete abroad with foreign manufacturers not subject to these restrictions and required payments.         We are disappointed that the June 20th agreement apparently cannot, in the present political environment, be enacted. An opportunity for our Company and the public has been lost by the failure of the political System to address the issues in a fair and responsible debate. We will, of course, continue to work toward reasonable Solutions to the problem of youth smoking. With respect to ongoing litigation, we will continue to act in the best interests of our stockholders and will defend or settle suits as appropriate. We must all recognize, however, that the present legislative and litigation environment is very uncertain and could result in major adverse consequences for our Company or rcquirc significant changes in its policies and practices.         Philip Morris will now apply its energies to oppose the McCain Bill because of the devastating impact it would have on our Company, our stockholders, our employees, customers, retailers, consumers, suppliers, growers, and others. Were the Bill to be enacted in its present form, we would refuse to sign on to provisions requiring our consent and would challenge the legality of the Bill in the courts. We ask that you, our stockholders, join us in our efforts to defeat this or any other damaging legislation and to help retum the debate about tobacco issues to a rational discussion of sensible policy alternatives. If you agree with me that the McCain Bill, or similarly punitive legislation, should be rejected, I urge you to communicate your views to the President, your Senators, and your House Representative. If you would like information as to the address or telephone number of your elected representatives, please call 1-888-609-9300. Yours sincerely,   Geoffrey C.

The bedspread uses the MARLBORO Red Roof trademark and tradedress in conjunction with the word Moracar, with a Capital M so that the bedspread appears much like the tradedress of our MARLBORO cigarette packages and is a clear copy of the MARLBORO McLaren Formula One Grand prix racing car.       As you may be aware, MARLBORO is the world's leading cigarette and the Red Roof Design is one of the most famous of all American trademarks. Moreover, while cigarettes are our major product, substantial business is done in several areas and, as you may also be aware, MARLBORO Sponsors several race cars and racing teams around the world, including the.World Champion Marlboro-McLaren Racing Team and the current CART-INDY car Champion.  MARLBORO, the MARLBORO Red Roof Design and the combination thereof are all trademarks owned by Philip Morris. Accordingly, the usage of our trademarks, tradedress and words and designs confusingly similar therewith infringe our rights under federal, state and common law. 2062099295"

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we would likely be amenable to resolving this matter on the following basis:        (a) Your advising us as to the names and addresses of the manufacturer and any intermediary suppliers of the bedspread;        (b) Provide us with the number of bedspreads sold to-date and as to any remaining stock on hand;        (c) Undertake to cease all further sale and distribution of the bedspread after the exhaustion of your current stock on hand.        I look forward to hearing from you promptly, in the hopes that this matter may be amicably resolved. BMK:em-r cc:       William A.    Slater        Rüben H.

MacKinnon             RE:   SALEM ULTRA  85mm PRODUCT  RECOMMENDATION Purpose Recommend the 85mm product for national introduction based on top-line product test results. Background Four product candidates and Triumph Menthol 85's were blind tested in NFO. All candidates used a single stage filter with a tar ränge of 3.7 to 5.2 mg. The tar level of Triumph was 2.8 mg. The minimum action Standards are: • Parity versus Triumph Menthol 85mm among SALEM LIGHTS 85mm smokers. • Parity versus Triumph Menthol 85mm among female fuller flavor low tar 85mm menthol smokers (excluding SALEM LIGHTS). Summary of Topline Results All four candidates met both action Standards (see Exhibits I and II). Candidate B (5.2 mg. tar) and Candidate C (4.9 mg. tar) exceeded the first action Standard by achieving superiority versus Triumph among the SALEM LIGHTS 85mm franchise:       Importantly, Candidate C was rated superior among females and older smokers. Candidate B was rated supe-rior among young adult smokers, a subgroup of lesser importance. While all candidates achieved the second action Standard of parity among competitive smokers, only Candidates B and C achieved higher absolute ratings among total female smokers albeit not a directional win. Candidate C achieved parity among all subgroups. Candidate B achieved superiority among younger adult female smokers, but lost to Triumph among males. Recommendation Candidate C, the 4.9 mg. product, is recommended for national introduction based on confirmation of final product test results. 50309 9906"

Importantly, it also achieved'superiority among females and older smokers. • Achieved high absolute ratings among total female competi-tive smokers, the second action Standard. Additionally, Candidate C achieved parity among males whereas Candidate B lost. • Tar level of Candidate C at 4.9 mg. versus 5.2 mg. for Candidate B provides greater flexibility to assure that the 5.0 mg. tar level declared in advertising will be maintained. • Tar level of Candidate C provides the opportunity for future advertising to declare a uniform tar level of 5 mg. for both styles as the recommended 100mm product is at a 4.5 mg. tar level. Candidate C is recommended as the 85mm style for national intro-duction. Final product test results on both styles will be available by Summary 5/30                                          W. K.

"Tobacco800";"edj50e00-first_1";"FirstPage";"    May 19, 19 88    Mr. E. D. Rains National Tobacco Company 3029 Muhammad Ali Boulevard Louisville, Kentucky 40212    Dear Gene:    As discussed during the meeting of May 16 between Lorillard and National,    I am summarizing our agreement relative to disposition of records.    All records located at National's Louisville, Kentucky facility relative to cigarettes are Lorillard's and will be shipped to Greensboro.    Re:   those documents that concern chewing tobacco and cigars, National    will receive the original. The Originals of any chewing tobacco/cigar related records in Greensboro which supported these aspects of Lorillard's business are National's property unless the original records are already contained in Louisville.    To the best of our knowledge, those records that are co-mingled (reports containing Information on chewing/cigars and cigarettes) do not disturb us, i.e. it would serve no logical purpose to physically dismantle those records removing only the cigarette-related Information.    Regarding Personnel-related records, we request the following due to Lorillard's continuing, substantial liability in this area:    1.  We  request that all personnel files                       for employees terminated prior         to the date of sale (April 26, 1988)                       be shipped to Greensboro.    2.  We  request copies of all Information        in      the personnel files of         employees currently employed (not terminated) up to the date of sale.    3.  MIS and Energy Management Department Personnel files should be         forwarded to Greensboro, if they have not already been forwarded to New York; this would be for current and terminated employees.    As Mr. Tom Moring had so graciously prepared a listing for our 5/16 meeting relative to Quality Control records, I attach that copy representing our agreed-upon disposition of those records.                                                                                  00                                                                                  n!

As I recall, you feit fairly certain that documents in this area have been destroyed for all years prior to 1985. Financial records:      All  records pertaining to cigarettes April 25, 1988 and prior are the property of Lorillard. We are extremely interested in those records involving the closing of cigarette production in 1985, all write-offs, ATF records, payroll records, return goods records, auditor records, operations analysis records, invoices, profit sharing records, fixed assets records, invoices, among other financial records contained at Louisville. Gene, as you know, we reached the conclusion, and you and I have already scheduled a date, that it would be best for Jerry Richardson and I to come to Louisville relative to the financial records, working with you and Alan Minsterketter to resolve disposition questions in this area. As you and I discussed by phone, we feel confident that we have the necessary purchasing records in Greensboro as we have copies of all purchase Orders here. At this time, we do not feel it imperative to obtain copies of the M&R parts purchase Orders prepared in Louisville, nor do we feel it is necessary to have copies of the contracts negotiated on a local, branch level by Louisville. For instance, the elevator service is locally negotiated and we feel, at this juncture, that it is not necessary to have a copy of that contract; if, in the future, a liability should accrue to Lorillard in that context, we feel certain that National would cooperate with us in allowing us to obtain the appropriate paperwork. If you have any difficulties in this area, please so advise me during my visit on Monday, May 23. On May 16, Bernie Head advised that he will forward to your attention four (4) boxes of Plant Engineering records which represent all the applicable Engineering records in Greensboro which are National's property. Regarding R&D, copies of Lorillard's Product Development Department work will be forwarded as soon as possible to Al Feige. As advised by Mr. Tedder, I will be the records liaison between Greensboro and Louisville. As I understand my role, if National requires copies of information, the appropriate person from National should contact me; if the reverse is true, I will contact the appropriate individual at National. I understand the National contact to be:            John Todd - Personnel; Gene Rains - All other areas.                                                                                    di                                                                                    C£>                                                                                    CO                                                                                    Cfl                                                                                    W"

I will be more than happy, Gene, to facilitate this process in any way possible and certainlv look foward to working with you, John, Alan, and Al in disposing of this matter as rapidly and expeditiously as possible.

Results indicate that SALEM King did meet the established action Standards of:  Action Standard  Overall Rating   1.  Higher overall rating vs. Kool King among    • SALEM King smokers    • Non-Kool competitive 85mm full flavor menthol smokers  SALEM rated higher than Kool SALEM rated higher than Kool   2.  Minimum parity rating vs. Newport King among    • SALEM King smokers    • Non-Kool competitive 85mm full flavor menthol smokers  SALEM rated higher than Newport SALEM rated at parity with Newport  In additlon, relative to the previous SALEM King competitive product test in 1977, SALEM King performs equal to/or better versus major competition among brand franchise smokers:  Franchise  1977 Overall Rating  1979 Overall Rating  Among SALEM King smokers  SALEM rated higher than Kool or Newport King.  Same  • Among Kool King smokers  Kool rated at parity with Newport; both brands rated higher than SALEM.  Same                                             • Among Newport King smokers  Newport rated higher than SALEM or Kool King.  SALEM rated at parity with Newport; both brands rated higher than Kool.  In conclusion, the 16 mg SALEM King product met the established action Standards and performs well versus Kool/Newport among brand franchise smokers. Therefore, the brand recommends not changing the current 16 mg product, but continue to work on the 15 mg product as part of the corporate tar reduction program. The 15 mg SALEM King prototype is currently available and will be NFO product tested with results avallable 4/15/80.  SLS/fd  cc: T. L. Ogburn H. E. Osmon B. S. Kirby U. Frydman D. W.

This measure, Assembly Bill 7139, seeks to prevent tobacco use by minors 1 other things, banning all cigarette advertising with the exception of ads that newspapers or magazines. This proposal is ill-conceived and potentially destructive to my industry, whi thousands of people in New York State. Studies both abroad and in the Uni have determined that cigarette advertising plays a minimal role in an individi to smoke. Peer influence, and the influence of parents and older siblings, is dominant factor. Banning advertising, therefore, will not afiect the incidenc by youths. Besides being ill-suited to achieve its stated purpose, this proposal is uncons Since the 1970's, the courts have ruled that commercial speech is protected i First Amendment. Unfortunately, by the time the courts get around to overl measure, the economic damage will already have been done to my industry < others. I hope you will take the above into consideration and oppose the passage of Vice President, Marketing ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING, INC. Bill 7139. CJF/sa"

The Council operates two application cycles per year and accepts oreliminarv inauiries year-round; the date of receipt by CTR determines the cycle in which the proposal is evaluated. Spring cycle - any inquiry received between February 16 and August 15 and encouraged by the Executive Committee may be submitted as a full application by November 30.       Fall cycle - inquiries received between August 16 and February 15 and encouraged by the Committee may be submitted as full applications by May 31:  Cycle Preliminary Inquiry   Deadline for   Notification Activation         Arrival at CTR      Full Application     Date           Date  Spring Feb 16 - Aug 15          Nov 30      Early May         Jul 1    Fall Aug 16 - Feb 15          May 31      Early Oct       . Jan 1  The format for the preliminary application is as follows: 1. A three page narrative summary. This should contain a synopsis of the proposed project including relevant background material, its present Status and goals, a brief outline of the research and its impact. The summary should end with a sentence indicating the anticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate of the anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three page limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature citations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the proposal, they must be accommodated within the three page limitation. 2. Two page curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal Professional level collaborators (the NIH format is quite acceptable). Again, the page limit is strictly enforced; only two pages per investigator are forwarded to the Committee. 3. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought. ADE/mla"

I had a confirmed first-class reservation on Pan Am Flight 201 to Rio de Janeiro last night, September 19, and was notified that I had a pre-confirmed reservation for Seat 5-A in the smoking section. At check-in I learned that I had been switched to Seat 1-A, non-smoking. Since I have been a cigarette smoker for many years (much longer than I have been in this business), I pointed out that a ten-hour flight under those conditions would be rather intolerable. Unfortunately, I was at a distinct disadvantage because the flight was sold out and a large number of standbys were at hand. In fact, a lady wait-listed for first dass was called to the desk early in our discussion to stand by pending disposition of my problem. It was evident that Pan Am did not have to be concerned whether or not I was on the flight. The seat would obviously be filled. The Supervisor who was called told me that he had asked the captain to release Seat 7-A from the crew rest seats but the captain had refused. Beyond that, efforts to accommodate me might best be described as half-hearted. So, in short, I did not get to Brazil. This entire episode has proved a great embar-rassment and frustration to me - to say nothing of the twenty people waiting for me in Rio and Sao Paulo for a scheduled two-day meeting. 2024270951"

Comments on a Nature article reporting the role of ß2 subunits of acethylcholine receptors in mediating dopamine reiease in the midbrain of mice by nicotine. 2. Transcript from BBC World Service Radio regarding the article above. 3. Comments on a Nature article reporting “a cellular basis for reports that the First cigarette of the day is the most pleasurable*. Please forward thi^ information to Drs. Ellis and Guliotta and appropriate colleagues. Note on “2."": •   Dr. Changeux     is the last author of the article by Picciotto et al. •   Dr. Changeux              describes “positive action of nicotine"", namely, as a cognition enhancer     as well as an             anxiolytic (page 3; there are obvious mistakes in the transcript such as     describing an                 anxiolytic to “increase* anxiety). Since ß2-lacking mutant mice show     higher ability of learning than the wild-type (see “1.” attached), it can be argued that the subunit functions as an “inhibitor” of learning. In this case the ability of nicotine to facilitate learning cannot be explained. • Dr. Changeux appears to think that there are several levels of “addiction” (page 4).

You agreed to let me know thereafter, and in any event before March 23,1999, whether or not the Branch Law Firm would submit a revised Cost Statement for consideration under the New Mexico Fee Payment Agreement, Submission of a revised Statement would restart the 30 business-day period, and - as I mentioned on the phone - the manufacturers would reserve all of their rights under the Agreement with respect to such a Submission, mcluding, without limitation, their right to conduct a full audit and/or to dispute the reimbursability of particular costs and expenses. vO   CP   04   Ln   cn   cn"

In the event the Original Participating Manufacturers elect to dispute the Submission, the FPA provides that the Submission shall be subject to a full audit by examiners to be appointed by the Original Participating Manufacturers (in their sole discretion). Pursuant to our agreement to extend the accept/dispute deadline under the FPA, an audit would be completed within 90 Business Days after March 23,1999. If, after the audit has been completed, you and the Original Participating Manufacturers are unable to agree as to the amount of your firm’s reimbursable costs and expenses, the FPA provides for arbitration. The amount of reimbursable costs and expenses determined pursuant to that arbitration is final, binding, and non-appealable.                    The other requests in your letters of February 16, 1999, and February 22, 1999, including your request for documents and depositions, are not appropriately addressed at this time. Should arbitration become necessary, you will no doubt request them again.     cc:      Paul   Bardacke, Esq,              Original Participating Manufacturers  003                                                                                                                                                                                             I 83555195"

Weissler, Assistant Director of R&D. In attendance were:            Mr. Pilkington, Pilkington Chemical Brokerage Company            Dr. Carl Kessler, Research Department, Penick & Ford, Ltd.            Mr. Carl Moeller, Sales Rep., Penick & Ford, Ltd.            Dr. William C. Squires, Research Department, RJR       Dr. Weissler had attempted to extend wort by addition of Vel-Bru during the busy season. As a result, the fermentations were ""sluggish"", i.e., slow or incomplete. Mr. Moeller related the use of Vel-Bru by several brewers. Amounts between 30 and 35% of the total were successfully employed. One brewer was successfully diluting his wort by 50% with Vel-Bru. At this point, Dr. Weissler revealed that they had attempted to dilute wort with 70% of Vel-Bru. The problem then appeared to be clear. By such extensive dilution with carbohydrates, the other nutrients in wort such as organic nitrogen, Vitamins and salts were probably at suboptimal levels.       Falstaff is not equipped to investigate the nutritional problems' involved. Dr. Weissler asked that P&F provide information on what to add to permit 70% dilution with Vel-Bru or to provide modified Vel-Bru.       It was suggested that RJR could and would investigate this problem, if wort and yeast were available. Dr. Weissler agreed to supply Falstaff wort and yeast cultures when we were ready. A time was not specified beyond stating that because of other investigations in progress, it might be as much as six months before we could initiate the study. WCS:Id Cc:    Eldon D.

I am pleased to enclose a Statement describing policies of The Council and a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently §upported. Our application procedure entails a mandatory two-step process. First, a short preliminarv inauirv is sent to members of the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluate it for scientific merit and for ""fit"" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. If the Committee’s review vote is positive, you will be provided with forms and instructions for completing a full application. In the event you receive an award, The Council will consider up to two annual renewals on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications.          The Council operates two application cycles per year and accepts preliminarv inauiries year-round; the date of receipt by CTR determines the cycle in which the proposal is evaluated. Spring cycle - any inquiry received between March 16 and September 15 and encouraged by the Executive Committee may be submitted as a full application by November 30.         Fall cycle - inquiries received between September 16 and March 15 and encouraged by the Committee may be submitted as full applications by May 31:  Cycle Preliminary Inquiry   Deadline for   Notification Activation         Arrival at CTR      Full Application     Date     Date        Spring Mar 16 - Sep 15          Nov 30      Early May    Jul 1         Fall Sep 16 - Mar 15          May 31      Early Oct    Jan 1       The format for the preliminary application is as follows: j 1. A three page narrative summary. This should contain a synopsis of the proposed project including relevant background material, its present Status and goals, a brief outline of the research and its impact. The summary should end with a sentence indicating the anticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate of the anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three page limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature citations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the proposal, they must be accommodated within the three page limitation.   2. Two page curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal Professional level collaborators (the NIH format is quite acceptable). Again, the page limit is strictly enforced; only two pages per investigator are forwarded to the Committee.  3. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought.

This measure, Assembly Bill 7139, seeks to prevent tobacco use by minors by, among other things, banning all cigarette advertising with the exception of ads that appear in newspapers or magazines. This proposal is ill-conceived and potentially destructive to my industry, which employs thousands of people in New York State. Studies both abroad and in the United States have determined that cigarette advertising plays a minimal role in an individual's decision to smoke. Peer influence, and the influence of parents and older siblings, is by far the dominant factor. Banning advertising, therefore, will not affect the incidence of smoking by youths. Besides being ill-suited to achieve its stated purpose, this proposal is unconstitutional. Since the I970's, the courts have ruied that commercial speech is protected vrnder the First Amendment. Unfortunately, by the time the courts get around to overtuming this measure, the economic damage will already have been done to my industry and many others. I hope you will take the above into consideration and oppose the passage of Assembly Bill 7139. Christopher J. Ferraro Vice President, Marketing ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING, INC. CJF/sa"

The funding and release of this study which, among other things, detailed the cost savings to the Czech Republic duc to premature deaths of smokers, exhibited terrible judgment as well as a complete and unacceptable disregard of basic human values.        For one of our tobacco Companies to commission this study was not just a terrible mistake, it was wrong. AU of us at Philip Morris, no matter where we work, are extremely sorry for this. No one benefits from the very real, serious and significant diseases caused by smoking.

Weis seems to peddle red herrings. In his February 7 letter, ""Clearing the air on office smoke,"" Weis asserted ""An employer that restricts smoking at the work-place and limits future hiring to nonsmokers should expect to save in excess of $5,000 per year per smoker...."" His laundry iist of alleged ""savings"" is old news, published in the May 1981 issue of Persorinel Administrator. Then, however, Weis was a bit more candid:     ""Skeptics might argue that these figures are as soft as the underside of a porcupine, and that may be true."" Unquestionably true. Last July 21 at an American Lung Association seminar in Bellevue, Washington, Weis told the audience he had done no primary research to support his Claims and then bemoaned the fact that an ALA newsletter had commented that his figures were ""600 times more expensive"" than other guestimates. P.S. (Not for publication):     I was very disappointed that instead of Publishing my December 2, 1982 letter (reminder copy enclosed), you chose to use the current Weis letter as another strike at this dubious subject. Perhaps the above could help even the score.                                   .Sincerely, WDTj r ::ms s Enclosure cc:   John A.  Dierdorff © Managing Editor  ©  00"

At the top speed production increase was approximately 10 per cent above normal rates without concentrated extract (normal dryer speed 285-295 ft./min.).        The use of concentrated extract will be shifted from the wet end to the product end sprays of the dryer during the coming week in order to see the advantage of using the higher strength extract there."

Last April, we sat down with State Attorneys General, class action plaintiffs’ lawyers and public health representatives in an efFort to resolve the numerous issues that have arisen conceming tobacco use in the United States. At that time, we faced significant litigation and regulatory risks to our domestic tobacco business, including a large and growing number of health-care cost recovery actions brought by various State Attorneys General; numerous class and individual smoking and health actions; and assertion of regulatory authority by the Food & Drug Administration under a Statute that, if determined by the courts to be applicable to tobacco products, could permit the FDA to alter those products radically or to ban them outright. We did not believe that endless litigation was in the long-term best interests of our stockholders, employees, customers, consumers, and suppliers.                 We believed that, if we could achieve a comprehensive settlement of all of these issues on terms that would give us predictability in our continuing business operations, it would be a better alternative for everyone. After eleven weeks of difficult, good-faith negotiations, we reached such an agreement: one that was very hard on the tobacco industry, but that would have permitted the 50 million adult Americans who choose to smoke to continue to do so without the endless debate and recrimination that have surrounded tobacco for decades. Some of the agreement’s terms were a bitter pill for us. They would have involved our voluntary waiver of certain constitutional rights (including our rights to conduct much of our advertising and marketing), and would have had a material adverse effect on the financial performance of our domestic tobacco business. Nevertheless, they would have provided us with a predictable business environment. The agreement would have required the industry to make very large payments — in perpetuity: $368.5 billion over the first 25 years alone, subject to adjustment to reflect inflation and volume reductions. Comprehensive, sensible FDA regulation would have been specifically defined. And the settlement would have resolved the State Attorneys General Iawsuits, placed limitations on our civil liability going forward, and avoided the possibility of FDA prohibition of tobacco sales to adults.                 While we were under no illusions that this settlement, which required legislative implementation, would be adopted word for word by the Congress, we had good reason to expect that it would not be totally rewritten in eveiy material respect. The Clinton Administration closely monitored the negotiations leading up to the June 20th settlement. It suggested, and the parties"
"Tobacco800";"fsh23c00-page04_2";"NextPage";"       # acceptedj resolutions of several of the most sensitive issues, such as the amount of industry moxietary payments and the basis on which it would be appropriate to bar punitive damages Claims based on past conduct         Unfortunately, it has now become clear that the process has become wholly politicized. Some political leaders have been more concemed with appearing to be “tough” on tobacco than with the practica! policy implications of legislative proposals. Few involved in the political process have been willing to say “no” in any way to so-called public health advocates who seek nothing less than the bankrupting of the tobacco industry and the early or eventual Prohibition of tobacco products.         The Bill sponsored recently by Senator John McCain and approved 19-1 by the Senate Commerce Committee is the product of this “process.” Although critical aspects of the legislation’s plan would require the industry’s consent, the industry was excluded from discussion both with the Administration about its monetary demands and with Senator McCain and his staff about the drafting of the Bill. The Bill substantially changes the June 20th settlement in almost every material respect. In fact, although the Bill calls for the tobacco industry to participate, to waive its constitutional rights, and to pay well over half a trillion dollars in the first 25 years, it does not provide the industry with predictability or any other meaningful benefit. In short, it is not a “settlement” at all, and thus is not something in which we can participate.         The price terms of the Bill are totally unreasonable. The nominal 25-year total has been increased to well over one-half a trillion dollars. But this is only part of the story. Among other things: •   Whereas the annual payments under the June 20th settlement were all to be adjustable for actual declines in sales volumes, the first six annual payments under the Bill — totaling over $115 billion — are fixed without regard to actual level of sales. No matter how much sales volume declines, and even if the FDA bans or radically alters tobacco products during this period, the industry still would have to pay this huge fixed sum. •   The ostensible “$1.10 per pack” Charge portrayed by the Bilks supporters as being the price of the Bilfs payments is simply wrong and misleading. Taking into account realistic estimates of the volume declines that would likely occur (even in the absence of FDA action), the actual amount that the industry would be required to pay would be more on the order of $1.70 per pack or higher. And that is before additional payments of up to $6.5 billion per year for litigation judgments and settlements; uncapped liability for awards of attorneys ’ fees to plaintiffs’ attorneys; and — after the first three years — an additional potential $3.5 billion per year in “look-back” penalties (which are now specified to be non-tax-deductible). Under the Bilks provisions, the total cost per pack to be paid by the industry could thus be more than double the advertised “$1.10 per pack.” •  Further, the increase in retail price to the consumer — taking into account both required and realistic mark-ups at the distribution and retail level, the effect of state and local sales taxes, and 2 83635766"

This regressive tax would be in excess of $1,000 per year for average smokers (the majority of whom eam less than $30,000 annually).         Beyond assessing these extraordinary monetary payments, the Bill would also destroy any possibility of predictability by leaving in place a system of untrammeled tort litigation. The billions of dollars of required payments do not even necessarily result in settlement of the State Attorneys General suits: the States can opt out with no resulting diminution in the industiy payments. The Bill also eliminates virtually all of the civil liability limitations of the June 20th settlement applicable to our tobacco business except for an annual cap on liability. But even this civil liability provision in the Bill is a mirage. The Bill calls for the liability cap to be revoked in response to a variety of developments over which we have no or very little control. To give just one example, the cap may be revoked at the discretion of the Secretary of Health and Human Services if one of the arbitrary targets for reduction in underage smoking is missed by more than 20 percentage points and the Secretary determines that underage use of our domestic subsidiary’s brands was “responsible” — not that we or our subsidiary did anything wrong. Let me emphasize that we are committed to discouraging and preventing underage smoking, but we cannot accept a “settlement” in which our purported “benefit” is forfeited if teenagers don’t do what we and society want.         The Bill exacerbates the issue of FDA-decreed Prohibition. Indeed, it would expressly confer that authority; the FDA would be empowered to decree an outright ban on tobacco products, an outright ban on nicotine, or virtually anything eise it wishes to mandate regarding the content of cigarettes that it determines in its discretion to be in the furtherance of “the protection of the public health.” The only practical limit on this virtually unrestrained authority is an exception that would permit both houses of Congress to vote down a complete ban on tobacco products or nicotine within two years of the FDA’s Institution of such a ban. Far from delineating specifically what federal bureaucrats could and could not do, the Bill simply leaves the tobacco industry’s continued business operations to the discretion of an unelected federal agency.         Finally, the Bill puiports to introduce prohibitive restrictions and taxes on our international tobacco company’s business. These include:  * Global application of the BiH’s severe advertising and promotion restrictions — even if competitors in foreign countries could advertise and promote without restriction — thereby placing American manufacturers at an extreme competitive disadvantage overseas. These advertising and promotion restrictions would apply not only to tobacco products exported from the U.S., but to products manufactured abroad by our foreign subsidiaries as well. * Global application of the domestic requirement that cigarettes be sold only in black and white packaging (except in “adult only” establishments). 3 83635767"
"Tobacco800";"fsh23c00-page04_4";"NextPage";"       # • Effectively requiring U.S. manufacturers to adhere to domestic performance Standards mandated by the FDA in their international exports. If the FDA banned or limited nicotine, or limited tar, the ban or limit would also apply to export products — again without regard to what foreign competitors could seil. • Imposition of an arbitrary tax of $1.00 per 1,000 cigarettes on all exports and foreign sales. For example, any one of our international Company’s Italian products manufactured and sold only in Italy would be subject to this tax. The BilFs international provisions would effectively destroy our international Company’s ability to compete abroad with foreign manufacturers not subject to these restrictions and required payments.         We are disappointed that the June 20th agreement apparently cannot, in the present political environment, be enacted. An opportunity for our Company and the public has been lost by the failure of the political system to address the issues in a fair and responsible debate. We will, of course, continue to work toward reasonable Solutions to the problem of youth smoking. With respect to ongoing litigation, we will continue to act in the best interests of our stockholders and will defend or settle suits as appropriate. We must all recognize, however, that the present legislative and litigation environment is very uncertain and could result in major adverse consequences for our Company or require significant changes in its policies and practices.         Philip Morris will now apply its energies to oppose the McCain Bill because of the devastating impact it would have on our Company, our stockholders, our employees, customers, retailers, consumers, suppliers, growers, and others. Were the Bill to be enacted in its present form, we would refuse to sign on to provisions requiring our consent and would challenge the legality of the Bill in the courts. We ask that you, our stockholders, join us in our efforts to defeat this or any other damaging legislation and to help return the debate about tobacco issues to a rational discussion of sensible policy alternatives. If you agree with me that the McCain Bill, or similarly punitive legislation, should be rejected, I urge you to communicate your views to the President, your Senators, and your House Representative. If you would like information as to the address or tele-phone number of your elected representatives, please call 1-888-609-9300. Yours sincerely,   Geoffrey C. Bible 4 83635768"

I advised you that upon even a cursory examination, the Submission presents certain obvious problems, and that perhaps it would be advantageous to address those problems sooner rather than later. For example (and only by way of example), the Original Participating Manufacturers are not likely to approve payment of amounts of expenses that are calculated by applying a “tobacco-related” percentage to your firm’s overall expenditures and resources. In addition, you appear to be seeking reimbursement for certain expenses or categories of expenses, such as Office supplies and office rent, that are not “of the same nature as costs and expenses for which the Original Participating Manufacturers ordinarily reimburse their own counsel or agents.” Agreement § 19(a). The Companies do not reimburse their own outside counsel for such expenses; even if an audit were to confirm that such expenses were actually incurred in connection with the New Mexico tobacco litigation (and I do not mean to suggest that they were not), the manufacturers would not pay them. oo OvJ cn cn cn ro o ON"

As it Stands now your Submission will likely be subject to a full audit. I therefore suggested, in the interest of minimizing delay and expense for aU parties, that the Original Participating Manufactures would consider a revised Statement that (1) provided an itemized breakdown of the expenses actually incurred in connection with the New Mexico action; and (2) limited the request for reimbursement to those expenses, and categories of expenses, that are appropriately payable under the Standard set forth in the Agreement. Submission of a revised cost Statement would restart the 30 business-day consideration period, and — to repeat what I emphasized in our conversation — the manufacturers would reserve all of their rights under the Agreement with respect to such a Submission, including, without limitation, their right to conduct a full audit and/or to dispute the reimbursability of particular costs and expenses.                     Whether or not to submit a revised cost statement is entirely your choice. You mentioned on the phone yesterday that you have the information that would be required for an itemization of costs and expenses. On the other hand, if you choose to proceed with the cost statement you previously submitted, we will review it consistent with the terms of the Agreement.

Philip Morris's estimate is that the retail prices of cigarettes will rise in nominal terms by an absolute minimum of $1.2O/pack by 2002 and $1-52/pack by 2007, reflecting increases of 66% and 84% respectively over present average prices.       In real terms, i.e., expressed in 1997 dollars, the retail price increases will be a minimum of $1.06/pack in 2002 and $1.19/pack in 2007, reflecting increases of 58% and 65% respectively.

Finally, in the estimate, the wholesaler and retailer margins expressed as a percentage of retail price are projected to decline from a prevailing level of 19% to 16% in 2002 and 15% in 2007.         The Philip Morris estimate may also be compared with the estimates of Wall Street analysts who are projecting retail price    1 Reflects on-going payments inflated at the minimum escalator of 3%.    2 Assumes industry price will increase by an annual Inflation rate of 2.5%.    3 Reflects an increase in the federal excise tax of $0.10/pack in 2000 and SO.15/pack in 2002.    4 Reflects prevailing national average tax of 4.7%.

In addition to the retail redeemable coupon section of the card, consumers will be offered an ""extra bonus"" from Merit (copy attached).  A D of A will be responsible for fulfillment of the ""extra bonus"" portion of this promotion. We anticipate that approximately 700,000 ""extra bonus"" requests will be received at P.O. Box 16095. Upon receipt, A D of A will record all information on the cards and segregate the ensuing smoker list into the following two groups:  I PHILIP MORRIS SMOKERS - All smokers who identify their usual brand of cigarettes as a Philip Morris brand will receive a _ Merit lighter. A listing of all PM brands is attached (Exhibit 1). A D of A can anticipate to fulfill approximately 400,000 such requests. Once the final size of the lighter blister card has been determined, you will be notified so that appropriate size K-Paks can be ordered. In addition, all legal requirements necessary to send lighters via mail must be satisfied.  II COMPETITIVE SMOKERS - All smokers who identify their usual brand of cigarettes as a brand other than a Philip Morris brand will receive three $2.00 off carton Coupons. A D of A will be provided with Coupons and envelopes necessary to fulfill this portion of the ""extra bonus"" offer. A D of A can anticipate approximately 300,000 such requests. Given that in some cases it will be impossible to determine the ""usual brand"" of cigarettes for consumers (ie: pack bottom not included, information panel not filled out properly), A D of A will process these ""unqualified"" consumers as competitive smokers.

Bible                                  -                                                                         CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFF1CER       November 16, 2001 Dear Shareholder:       I am writing about an exciting announcement that we are making today. At our next Annual Meeting of Shareholders, in April 2002, we will be proposing a change in the name of our parent Corporation, from Philip Morris Companies Inc. to Altria Group, Inc. This change will require the approval of our shareholders, and you will have the opportunity to vote on this proposal at next years meeting,       I want to take this opportunity to explain directly to you, as a valued shareholder, why we are proposing a name change, why we believe the txining is appropriate and why we have selected the name Altria Group, Inc.               • The name change is designed to achieve clarity. Currently, Philip Morris is part of the name of our parent Company as well as our two tobacco operating Companies - Philip Morris U.S. A. and Philip Morris International Inc. As a result, people often refer to the wrong Company when talking about “Philip Morris."" We regulär ly see examples of this in the media and in conversations with numerous stakeholders. A new name for the parent Company should help clarify our corporate identity, and make it clearer when reference is made to each of our tobacco operating Companies.               • This is a good time in the Company ’s evolution to adopt a new name. The Nabisco acquisition and the Kraft initial public offering provlde the most recent evidence of our growth and evolution. The acquisition of numerous global consumer packaged goods brands over the past decade provides an additional example of how we have changed. We are evolving culturally, too, as we work diligently on a variety of responsibility initiatives, both at the corporate level and within each of the operating Companies.               • Theproposed name fits our mission. Altria Group, Inc. - the new parent Company name we will be proposing to you - embraces innovation, growth and new opportunities. Altria, derived from the Latin word altus, meaning high, symbolizes for us a Company that is already great, but reaching ever higher. The name was chosen to reflect our aspiration to be a financially strong global family of consumer products Companies that delivers peak performance, shareholder value and growth through operational excellence, consumer brand expertise and a commitment to responsible business practices."
"Tobacco800";"gnx21c00-page02_2";"NextPage";" Page 2  November 16, 2001  In addition to the proposed new name, we have developed a new logo for the parent Company to express the enormous global diversity of our brands and our people. A sample of the “Mosaic” design is reproduced on the enclosed card.  If the proposed name change is approved by shareholders, we will also change the name of Philip Morris Capital Corporation to Altria Capital Corporation. We will not change the names of our operating Companies:          Philip Morris Incorporated (Philip Morris U.S.A.)          Philip Morris International Inc.          Kraft Foods Inc.          Miller Brewing Company  We remain committed to each of these businesses and plan to continue fully supporting and building the equity established over many years in the Philip Moms name for our domestic and international tobacco Companies.  I also want to reassure you that certain things will not change with a new name. We look forward to continuing the many important relationships with business partners, organizations and the financial community. We believe these relationships will only be strengthened by our name change. Nor will our 40-plus year commitment to charitable giving be diminished in any way by this action.  In closing, I would like to thank each of you, as valued shareholders, for your continuing support.  Yours sincerely,  Geoffrey C. Bible  Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer  We are not soliciting and will not accept any proxies at this time, but will do so in the ordinary course of Holding our annual meeting next April. We urge all shareholders to read our proxy Statement because it will contain important Information about the proposal Our proxy materials will be available to shareholders free of charge from us in March 2002 and at the Securities and Exchange Commission ’s (SEC) website (www.sec.gov). 2085575778"

Cobbs Editor Business Week McGraw-Hill Building 1221 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10020 Dear Mr. Cobbs: Did a bit of hyperbole creep into your report that a ""fewM Companies ""have already bowed to militant nonsmokers and ceded them their own territory in Offices, and factories,"" a Situation that you then called a ""war"" between smokers and nonsmokers that has ""invaded the Corporation""? Perhaps the battlefield analogy was drawn because the author of your November 2.9 piece, ""Office smokers feel the heat,"" relied almost exclusively on the views expressed by fringe anti-smoking groups such as ""ASH"" and ""GASP."" The real issue -- unanswered by the article -- is whether or not the vast majority of business managers are going to acquiesce to the demands of a small, yet vocal minority of anti-smokers, not nonsmokers, who are interested in imposing their ideas on the rest of us. Perhaps managers will continue to use good sense in handling, on a case-by-case basis, what is, in reality, a minor question. Courtesy, common sense, and a mutual respect and tolerance for the preferences of others have been successfully employed for centuries. The public has voted on proposed smoking restrictions involving private property six times in the past five years -- twice in statewide California elections. With more than 15.5 million bailots cast, all six measures were given thumbs down. If the anti-smokers were operating a sports franchise, their 0-6 record would put them in the eellar of their activist league.,  ©  CJ  tn  tn  ©  ©  © TOTjir ::mss"

Moore Weekly Report - April 16-27, 1973 Project 2903 — Service to Manufacturing        Use of Concentrated G-7 Extract        Some spotting by extract was noted on all G-7 sheet made while using extract from the aeration evaporator containing 24 to 32 percent solids* for the wet end extract sprays. However, a smoking evaluation on 100 percent G-7 cigarettes indicated that the spotting which occurred when using a 25 percent extract was not detrimental.        Three running periods of 13, 4 1/2, and 4 1/2 hours, respectively, using concentrated extract on the wet end of No. 4 Dryer havg^been made during an interval of about eight days. The first two test rtfns were made at dryer speeds of 300 to 310 ft./min. using 7 0.101-in. dia. sprays at 21-22 psi. although during the wfaole test period the wet pulp sheet was not very satisfactory and a 3.8 gm./sq. ft. sheet had to be used. The third test run was made using 10 0.0935-in. dia. sprays at 18 psi. and a 315 ft./min. dryer speed which was the maximum obtainable with present No. 4 dryer and wet machine speed Controls. These speeds compare with a 285 ft./min. speed normally used during the same period and indicated production rate increases up to 11 percent obtainable by using the extract of 25% solid content at the dryer inlet.        With this increase above the normal 20% extract it was possible to increase the proportion of solids applied at the dryer inlet from -20% to 35% of the total extract solids applied to the sheet. Product had satisfactory flavor and moisture content but was slightly heavy       because of use of the   heavier pulp sheet. Sheet shrinkage was about         the same as for normal Operation and no problem was*experienced in using a can        of the test run tobacco set up to  contain 14.3 percent moisture and stored for 2     days.        Additional tests are planned using a more concentrated extract on the feed end of the dryer.        *(Note) All extract solid concentrations reported here were determined on the basis of Development Lab moisture analyses which show a 3 to 5 percent lower solids content than do the plant control tests. The possibility of changing the plant test method is being considered."

The memorandum summarized the threshold requirements, in terms of the appropriate categorization of costs and supporting information, for a Cost Statement to be submitted pursuant to the New Mexico Fee Payment Agreement.                          Your December 30,1998, letter to Meyer G. Koplow, which was prepared before circulation of the aforementioned memorandum, lacks some of the supporting information that we require and makes it difficult for us to reach an infonned decision as to reimbursement of reasonable costs and expenses for New Mexico Outside Counsel. For example (and only by way of example), the letter provides no explanation for “offtce space” charges of $63,929.32, or “long distance” charges of $33,866.45,                                                                                                              co                                                                                                              CM                                                                                                              cn                                                                                                              cn                                                                                                              cn                                                                                                              to                                                                                                              o                                                                                                              so"

M. MATUL1S  DR. T. C. HSIEH/bfw/316 & «15 ANALYSES OM MLSCORE FREPARAT1OR  DATE .  MARCH 5, 1980 The tnuscone sample fron you has been analyzed by capillary GC/mass spectrometry in both electron itnpact and Chemical ionization modes. Figure T shows the total ion chromatograw. The spectral data gave the molecular weight information as follows: peak A, 238; peak E; 238; and peak C, 236. The natural muscone (3-methylcvclopenta-decanone-1) has a molecular weight of 238. Both methylcyclopentadecanone and methylcyclopentadecenol have a molecular weight of 238, while both methylcyclopentadecenone and methylcyclopentadecadienol have a molecular weight of 236. The possibility of alcohols was mied out since neither trifluoroacetylation nor trimethylsilylation treatment changed the behavior of these three componeots as revealed by gas chromatography. This finding is consistent with the chemistry of ketones which do not have replaceable protons for the above reactions. In summary, peaks A and B can be tentatively assigned as isoiners of 3-methylcyclopentadecanone (a total of seven isoiners possible) while peak C as methylcyclopentadecenone. If unequivoZcal Identification is necessary, authentic Standards have to be acquired for comparisons since Standard spectrum is not available.

International Corporate Center 555 Theodore Fremd Avenue Rye, NY 10580                             Re: ULT/LT Model Development for Selective Binding Dear Susan:                             Attached are my corrections to the Simmons Tar level classifications that you sent to us. Since MRD recently audited the brand information on the database, we should use the tar level classifications on the database. Hopefully, this recategorization of the tar levels will bring the percentage of full flavor smokers up closer to 38%. According to our latest MSA data, about 38% of the category is full flavor and the remainder is low tar (49%) and ultra low tar (13%).                             There are a few newer brands missing from the 1991 Simmons information. Most of these are franchise brands (Bull Durham, Misty, Montclair, Riviera). This is not really an issue since we would not want to target our franchise brands for Carlton selective binding anyway. The competitive brands that are missing are as follows: Merit Ultima, Saratoga, Savannah, Savvy and Sterling. Of these, Merit Ultima is the only brand that is a ULT full revenue target for Carlton.                             If possible, the model should prioritize full revenue ULT/LT brands. We have seen from our NOTS data that 96% of Carlton inswitchers come from full revenue brands. We may want to weight tar level as well. 47% of the inswitchers come from low tar brands and 30% from ULT brands.

Elimination of all MARLBORO (word) trademarks, or any            portion thereof and elimination of all Red Roof Designs (with or without MARLBORO) appearing in the video graphics of the subject game including, but not limited            ®            to those appearing in the photograph enclosed with your            ^            letter;                                                          <53                                                                                03       2.

Max Frankel Editor of Editorial Page New York Times 225 Nest Ürd Street New York, New York 10036 Dear Mr. Frankel: Unfortunate ly, your March 2 7 news report on a study by California researchers who clain to have found that.environmental tobacco smoke. is harraful to the health of nonsmokers , overlooked the caveats raised by Dr. Claude Lenfant of the National Institutes of Health, whose editorial -* which your Story otherwise quoted extens ively - - accoffipanied the study in the New England Journal cf Medieine. The saroe was true of your April 2 editorial, ""Thy Neighbor's Lungs."" Dr. Lenfant wrote:      ""Generally  speaking,  the  evidence that passive smoking in a general environment has health effects reaaiiis sparse, incomplete and scraetimes unconvineing."" He went on to point out that ""there Is no proof as yet that the reported reduction in airways function has any physiological or clinical consequences. The study is confined to only one aspect of an issue too complex to be resolved on such a limited basis."" TheA conclusions reached by Drs. White and Froeb also are at odds with the latest judgment of the 13. S. Surgeon General. His 1979 Report on Smoking and Health, which addressed this issus, found: ""Heslthy nonsmokers exposed to cigarette smoke have little or no Physiologie response to the smoke, and what response does occur may be due to psychological factors."" Clearly, the California study, which will nov be subject to objective and critical review within the scientific commuuity, should not be considered the ""final word,” For the Times to advocate public policy which would dictate social behavior and discriminate agair.st over a third of the adult population on the basis of this study, seems highly premature and totally out-of-character.

C« Hab er kern, with Messrs.  P. Frank Hanes and E. H. Harwood attending, met ln Mr.  P. Frank Hanes* Office on Ootober 7» 194-7« This group discussed the advisability of using Ar lex as a oondition-ing and softening agent for plug tobaooo.       Mr* Whitaker informed the group that the Manufacturing Department has been interested in Arlex for the past several years but our Purchasing Department oould not obtain this material* The manufaoturer (Atlas Powder Co*) now informs us that due to expanded manufaoturing facili-ties they can supply us up to 200,000 pounds of Arlex per month•       Mr. Harwood stated that tests made in Chemioal Labo-ratory showed Arlex to be better than Glyoerine for condi-tioning plug tobacco. Arlex was found to be very oompati-ble with plug tobacco. It has a permanent softening effeot since Arlex is not volatile and does not orystallize. On the other hand, Glycerine is not permanent as it is sorne-what volatile and is less effective for oonditioning plug tobacoo. Arlex is a syrup having a bland, sweet taste.  It oonsists ehiefly of d-Sorbitol. d-Sorbitol is a hexa-hydrio aloohol which oecurs in nature, being widely dis-tributed in fruits and berries. Arlex is made oorameroial-ly from glucose.       Mr. Harwood recommended using up to 5% of Arlex on plug tobaooo to replaoe the Glyoerine used. Mr. Glenn sug-gested that a carload of Arlex be purohased and the change-over from Glyoerine to Arlex be made gradually. These recommendations were approved by the Formula Committee and Mr. Haberkern was instructed to purchase a tank oar of Arlex.                                                                                             *                                                                                             o                                                                                             a"

This measure, Assembly Bill 7139, seeks to prevent tobacco use by minors by, among other things, banning all cigarette advertising with the exception of ads that appear in newspapers or magazines. This proposal is ill-conceived and potentially destructive to my industry, which employs thousands of people in New York State. Studies both abroad and in the United States have determined that cigarette advertising plays a minimal role in an individual's decision to smoke. Peer influence, and the influence of parents and older siblings, is by far the dominant factor. Banning advertising, therefore, will not affect the incidence of smoking by youths. Besides being ill-suited to achieve its stated purpose, this proposal is unconstitutional. Since the 1970's, the courts have ruled that commercial speech is protected under the First Amendment. Unfortunately, by the time the courts get around to overtuming this measure, the economic damage will already have been done to my industry and many others. I hope you will take the above into consideration and oppose the passage of Assembly Bill 7139. Christopher J. Ferrarc Vice President, Marketing ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING, INC.

Greiner Director - Business Development Petersen Publishing Company 110 Fifth Avenue New York, NY 10011   Dear Chris:   Many thanks for your June 17 letter (attached) which clarifies the age demographics of both 4 Wheel and Ojf-Road and Sport Truck subscribers.   We are somewhat concemed, however, by your Statement that ""Bind-in surveys are not a very reliable means to get statistically reliable data"". While this does not refer to the information you provided for 4 Wheel and Off Road and Sport Truck, it does call into question the reliability of ""in book survey"" information provided for other Petersen books which PM USA has already approved for advertising based on John Pagliaro's memo dated May 29 (also attached).   In addition, John's letter indicated a subscriber mail study, not a phone survey, was being conducted for Sport Truck and Four Wheel and Off Road.   Pending further clarification from you regarding the above, the Suspension of PM USA advertising in 4 Wheel and Off Road and Sport Trude will remain in effect. Your input clarifying demographic Information/research methodology for all Petersen books noted in John's May 29 letter would be appreciated by Wednesday, July 1. This will enable PM USA to make a final decision conceming the continued viability of its tobacco advertising in Petersen books which have either been recently approved or suspended.   Please call me at (212) 880-3591 if you have any questions. Director, Media  IO  O  00   RJC/em cc* R. Schneider - PM S. Piskor-PM J. Murillo - PM C.

Dear Mr. Orrick:           We are transmitting to you herewith a copy of the Cigarette Advertising Code promulgated by the nine principal cigarette manufacturing Companies. The Companies subscribing to the Code are The American Tobacco Company, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, Larus & Brother Company, Inc., Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard Company, Philip Morris Incorporated, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Stephano Brothers, Inc., and United States Tobacco Company,           We have been requested by these Companies to submit the Code to the Department and to request confirmation from the Department that the signatory Companies will not be prosecuted or sued under the federal antitrust laws by reason of their adherence to the Code. The Code is not effective now, and it will not become effective until such clearance is received from the Department. This condition was explicitly understood by all Companies throughout the discussions leading to formula-tion of the Code.           The Code will be implemented through a non-profit mambership Corporation being created by the nine Companies, the activities of which Corporation will be confined to the provisions of the Code."

Currently These Brands Are WINSTON SUPER KING SIZE, SALEM SUPER KING SIZE, WINSTON MENTHOL SUPER KING SIZE, WINSTON SUPER CRUSH PROOF And CAMEL TALL.    To: Mr. B. K. Millaway, Jr.                     From: j. l. Keaton       Manufacturing Office                Paragraph one of the August 12, 1971, minutes of the August 6, meeting of the Filter Process Study Committee, stated that at the conclusion of a three truckload test of Eastman 4.2/40,000, a memorandum of recommendation would be submitted to Mr. B. K. Millaway, Jr.                As Information, the current 5/45,000 tow is running tight after the delivery roll. This creates some problems with wrinkled filtere. Aleo, as anticipated we are getting some decrease in firmness with 4.2/40,000 tow. However, the firmness of the filtere with the 4.2/40,000 tow will be approxi-mately equivalent to the firmness of our King Size Cigarette filters.                Attached are summaries of. all analytical test results and smoker's test results.                Because of the satisfactory test results, it is recommended that Eastman 4.2/40,000 be approved as a replacement for Eastman 5/45,000 for any brand using or authorized to use 5/'4>,UUU Eastman tow as soon as practical.                Test results indicate that the net savings will be equivalent to a 5% tow weight reduction or approximately $220,000 annually.                                                                                                          y. s. ___________________________                                                                                                          (fj.',L.'

"Tobacco800";"ihz25e00";"FirstPage";"Honorable Larry Seabrook Legislative Office Building Room 704 Albany, NY 12248 Dear Mr. Seabrook: A bill currently making its way through the New York Assembly poses a severe threat to the promotional marketing and advertising industries. This measure, Assembly Bill 7139, seeks to prevent tobacco use by minors by, among other things, banning all cigarette advertising with the exception of ads that appear in newspapers or magazines. This proposal is ill-conceived and potentially destructive to my industry, which employs thousands of people in New York State. Studies both abroad and in the United States have determined that cigarette advertising plays a minimal role in an individual's decision to smoke. Peer influence, and the influence of parents and older siblings, is by far the dominant factor. Banning advertising, therefbre, will not affect the incidence of smoking by youths. Besides being ill-suited to achieve its stated purpose, this proposal is unconstitutional. Since the 1970's, the courts have mied that commercial speech is protected under the First Amendment. Unfortunately, by the time the courts get around to overtuming this measure, the economic damage will already have been done to my industry and many others. I hope you will take the above into consideration and oppose the passage of Assembly Bill 7139. Chnstopher J. f errarov Vice President, Marketing ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING, INC.

MEMORANDUM:       The need for more adequate and specific flltratlon of tobacco smoke led to the consideratlon of varlous for ras and sources of charcoal for use as a filter aid. An lnexpenslve source of charcoal havlng specific, high, absorptlon capacity was sought.       Burley stems have long been in excesslve supply. It was conceived by the wrlter that charcoal cpuld be nade from them at low cost and, ln addltlon, that burley steochSfcfcoal, because of lts tobacco origln, mlght have greater specific absorptlon capacity for tobacco smoke constltuents than other charcoals.       When burley stems were heated ln natural atmosphere or ln a rarefled atmosphere, they ignlted. The oxygen was thought to have been supplied by nitrates and other compounde occurring naturally ln the stems.       Burley stems were soaked ln water overnlght, drained, rinsed, and dralned agaln in an effort to remove nitrates and other forms of comblned oxygen which would support combustion. These extracted stems, both wet and after drying, were heated to 350° C. in a sheet-steel Container untll vapors ceased flowing from small vents. The stems were then thoroughly charred but not burned.       When higher temperatures were applied in a furnace, the time requlred was lessened. At about 410* C., the vapors ignlted as they were emltted from the vents produclng a clean blue flame. The charrlng process was corapleted as before.       The stera charcoal was ground in a Wiley Mi11 to a partlcle sire suitable for use in cigarette filter tlps. The fines were sifted out and constltuted an estimated 10 percent by welght. They could be used for other purposes. 50417"
"Tobacco800";"ijt58d00-page02_2";"NextPage";"2      This proeess for preparlng stem charcoal la well sulted for contlnuous Operation. Countercurrent extraction would minlmlze the anount of water or solvent mlxtures employed. The concentrated stem extract could be used as such or after modifIcation for upgrading tobacco products. A contlnuous flow of extracted stems on a conveyor through a furnace would char the stesm producing a conslderable amount of combustable vapors which could be fed Into the heatlng System thereby mlnlmlslng the cost of fuel and at the same time destroylng the vapors. The stem charcoal would then be fed directly Into ml Hing equlpment and to mechanlcal sleves and fllter-rod-formlng equlpment.      This dlsclosure of a proeess for siaklng burley stem charcoal ls not limited ln purpose to cigarette fllter preparatlon but applles to any other uses of this charcoal.

Aa you may know, we have been plagued by an off-taste früm cigarettes made with Ecusta’s Velvet Paper which contains hydrated magnesium oxide. Since you have been successful using fillers other than Mg{0H)2 to produce a paper which reduces SS-TPM equivalent to Velvet, this offers an opportunity to determine whether the off-taste is specific to the Mg(01i)2 filier or whether it is a resnlt of the sidestream reducing mechanism. If it is possible, could you provide us with some samples of paper which reduce SS-TPM sitnilarly to Velvet (n- 50%) , but which do not contain magnesium compounds. This would allow us to hand roll a few samples to compare with Velvet. One or two 45 cm strips of each sample would be sufficient. Once the cigarettes were tested, we would be happy to share the results. Thank you. Siucereiy, F. K. St .Charles FRS/sek/J24 04961 cc:   Dr. C. I. Ayers       Mr. E. E. Kohnhorst  620305383"

Louisville, KY 40218 Dear Ms. Bodi; Per our conversation of October 15, 1980, this is your authorization to conduct a product test for Brown & williamson Tobacco Corporation for $2,550 (rebid) using 200 smokers (1/2 male/1/2 female) equally divided among full-taste smokers and mainstream hi-fi smokers (see attached list of valid smokers). In screening for smokers their ""most often brand"" must be from the attached list. Respondents must be 21 or older and not be concentrated in any age group. Questionnaire and product will be supplied by us. Questions to be asked are preference, strength, and taste/flavor. The study should be conducted by having respondents come in and pick up their cigarette and a questionnaire, and after 3-4 days you would call them back for their responses. You will provide us with the completed tally sheets showing responses in totals by smoker group and by sex within smoker groups. There should also be breaks by age within groups."

Specifically:                    A) It now appears that despite multiple verbal and at least one written (see attached) confirmation the talent was not, and presumably never was going to be, bought out.                    B) lf these models were selected by LCF&L in New York, then naturally LCF&L must have been in contact with the Atanta agency and photographer. Wouldn't advance bookings have been made, locking us in at ""pre-Elite"" rates?                   C) The photography was shot at the end of August, 1988.                        Why would LCF&L wait until December 21, to notify us of                        a substantial deviation from your approved Authorization?                   As you know, the current New England/Pacific Northwest TAREYTON advertising program is a test of support in strong Brand territories. The expansion of the program into additional areas next year has been a clear and often discussed possibility. Accordingly, we need to see what two years of talent usage will cost us to fully ascertain the price of this job executed as originally discussed.                        SIX STAMFORD FORUM P.O.

The attached summary is belng dictatcd hastily. It should obviously be revised by the fine hands of Wood ward and McDowell and the members of the Steering Committee. But I forward it at your request so that there will be somcthlng for discussion at Monterey. I am also forwarding a copy to Blücher, Jack, Jack and Dick, who can bring their copies with them.             1 would strongly recommend that no letter be circulated to employees until the Steering Committee actually cowmoncrs the cnmpainn, and I would think that all mcrolH?r:; of Ihr Slooring Conwittcc should consider a similar or identical letter for their own sales force in California.

The minor Feak E has a molecular weight of 220 and is not oxacyclohexa-decan-2-one or its Isomers.

SALEM FÜLL FLAVOR 85*s/100 's Manufacturing Start  Charlie Snyder indicated that the Start of national manufacturing for the 15 mg. 85's can be accelerated to coincide with a start-up on 100's on 5/27. Apparently, this is possible because CAMEL Filter no longer needs the skip-gap-gummers and, therefore, they are cur-rently available for SALEM.  Management Approval  The Brand Group will forward a recommendation on 3/31 seeking approval by 4/3 to accommodate 1) timing to Start re-engraving advertising to reflect revised T&N numbers and 2) to advise Charlie Snyder of Management' 8 decision on 85's/100's so manufacturing start-up can occur on 5/27.

This measure requires Wholesale and retail dealers to take an inventory of all cigarettes on the effective date. Therefore, at the close of business on May 30, you are to take a complete inventory of all packages of 20s in your possession bearing Rhode Island state tax stamps. This inventory must be mailed to this office May 30. On June 2, we must remit the tax due to the State of Rhode Island.            If your territory includes another state in addition to Rhode Island and you are working in that state on May 30, you should not, of course, have any Rhode Island taxed merchandise on hand. However, you should inform us by letter to this effect.            The quantity of 20s reported on your inventory should be raulti-plied by 5 cents and this amount should be deducted from your Expense Account. Our Tax Department will remit the same amount to the State of Rhode Island.            Beginning on the effective date, you are to seil all merchandise in your possession at the new increased prices.            Please retain this letter as proof of the fact that the new tax rate has been complied with in the event you are questioned by an agent of the State Tax Commission. 990683481 PRODUCED FROM B&W WEB SITE"

R. A. Sanford 1/11/67  Even though the unidentified constituent (ter.tatively identified as di-butyl phthalate) present Ln the complaint sample was also fonnd in normal KOOL production samples, it was feit necessary to obtain a more positive identification and to determine its source. A number of raw materials were obtained from the factory and analyzed chromatographically. The unidentified peak was found in the tipping adhesives and collected for a more positive Identification, Spectroscopic data ider.tified the material as a di-butyl phthalate.  Mr, James Hume of the Purchasing Department contacted the supplier and they said that di-isobutyl phthalate is a constituent of the tipping adhesives.

I am the newest member of the Harley-Davidson marketing team and share responsibility along with Andy Pasheluk and Victor Lindsley in developing Harley-Davidson cigarettes. Currently, we are proposing to test Harley-Davidson cigarettes in three new markets - Portland, Oregon; Eugene, Oregon and, the state of Arkansas. We also plan to re-introduce Harley-Davidson into Indiana with a new marketing strategy. We have developed a new Full-Flavored product along with a Lights product. Both these products will be tested in all markets. In addition, we will be offering Harley-Davidson cigarettes at different price points. In Portland and Eugene, Harley-Davidson will be sold at full price (as tested previously in Indiana) and in Indiana and Arkansas, Harley-Davidson will be sold at a reduced or ""generic"" price. In accordance with our contract with you, I have enclosed one set of full size and one set of reduced size reproductions of point-of-sale piece mechanicals we are producing for these tests. In addition, I have enclosed reproductions of our advertising material."
"Tobacco800";"jke80e00_2";"NextPage";" Page 2  Mr. Jeffrey L. Bluestein Generally, the point-of-sale pieces we will produce for our test markets mirror pieces produced in the past. However, you will notice that there are three versions of each piece. Pieces that simply indicate ""Full Flavor and Lights"" are being produced for Portland and Eugene; pieces that have a ""Generic Price"" shield are being produced for Arkansas; and pieces that have a ""New Generic Price"" shield are being produced for Indiana. Actual pieces of all point-of-sale material will be available and forwarded to you as soon as possible. Sincerely, Constance Fassuliotis Assistant Brand Manager /ec cc:   R. Goldbrenner       V.

I am pleased to enclose our Statement of Policy, Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists currently supported grants and contains abstracts of papers that have appeared over the last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research.         Our two-step application process is described on a separate enclosed sheet; it addresses several topics including eligibility, funding levels, award duration and specific instructions for submitting a Preliminäry Application. Each application is reviewed by members of our Scientific Advisory Board, a panel of established biomedical scientists who serve as our peer review committee.         Briefly, applicants must be faculty level scientists having appointments at not-for-profit institutions. The Council supports independent investigator-initiated projects (one, two or three years) in a variety of biomedical research areas. In the event you receive an award, annual, non-competing renewal applications are required and continued funding is based on your progress and the materials you submit with the renewal request forms.         The Council encourages proposals from younger researchers, but as you will see from the Annual Report, a number of our awardees are established scientists. Complete scientific freedom is assured and our only expectation is publication of research results in appropriate peer-reviewed journals.            encl.            A"

Hatch 0nited States Senator Chairman/ Committee on the Judicxary United States Senate Washington./ D.C. 20S1G-6275 Dear Senator Hatch:             I am enclosing answere to the     gnestions of Senators Leahy    and Kohl that you forwarded                to me on July 28, 1997. The answers have been prepared as responses by all of the Companies that are parties to the settlement, thus they reflect a joint industry response rat her than the response of only one Company or a personal response by me. Each of the cigarette manufacturers has determined to respond to Senator Kennedy's guestion individual ly and individual Company responses to those questions will be delivered today or tomorrow to you and to Senator Kennedy.             I personally regret the                             delay       that has been entailed in responding to these guestions. I would have hoped that responses could have been completed earlier than now. The attention that members of the Committee have paid to this matter is deeply appraciated. I hope that the tardiness of the responses has not excessively complicated the work of the Committee.

Hockett, Ph.D.,    The Council for Tobacco Research,    110 East 59th Street,    New York, H. Y. 10022 U.S.A.    Dear Doctor Hockett:             Safely back in Winnipeg where we are shivering in -20° weather, 1 wista to thank you for inviting me to the Conference on the macrophage. Taken as a «hole I thought tbe Conference was valuable although I must admit to some synaptic overload during the first part of the Friday morning session.             As 1 left you asked for comments, so perhaps I may pinpoint the particular areas that impressed me.             Ön the first day, the work of Joseph Guarneri continues to impress me; here is a wealth and depth of knowledge and the combination of in-vivo and vitro models has much to off er in the elucidation of disturbed macrophagic function.    It became clear, as the discussion progressed, that there are significant gaps in Our knowledge about bactericidal mechanisms in the lung. Is it related sblely to the macrophage or are other factors such as Surfactant involved too?             The two papers on scanning electron microscopy were fascinating and, of course, very beautifully presented. 1 think it was interesting to see the surface changes in the adapted or angry macrophages but tbe long ränge significance of this is doubtful. S.E.M. may perhaps, because of its low magnification, be of some use in quantitative studies, but 1 don't see it as a major investigative tool.             After lunch on Thursday, the papers of Cross and Mustafa emphaeized an important parameter, the metabolic adaptive changes that occur when the macrophage is irritated in any way. It is important to look at the macrophage in this way since it is becoming apparent that the adaptive capacity of the macrophage is great and only when this capacity is exceeded may we expect trouble."

H K02287065         Of the Friday sessions 1 was particularly impressed with Jim Travis' approach to protein cbemistry and the utilization of his meticulous techniques for thfe investigation of proteolytic enzymes. Here is a bullt in quality control for any experiments your other grantees may conduct in this difficult field. The work he is doing is basic and of high quality.         In the final paper, Shirley Kaufman demonstrated once again her sound grasp of the cytodynamics of the lung. She has developed a reliable and repro-ducible model for cellular quantitation; now she has to decide what definitive experiments can be built around this precise model.         These are hurried and somewhat extemporaneous comments but if I don't write them down and mail them to you today, chances are that you111 nevcr have any comments at all!         Once again, my thanks to you and your staff for a delightful and thought provoking meeting. It is hard to document the benefits that accrue from personal interchanges during such a small meeting, but I'm certainly glad I came.         With best wishes.                                          Yours sincerely                                             Drummond H. Bowden, M,D. DHB/em. Enc."

This measure requires Wholesale and retail dealers to take an in-ventory of all cigarettes on the effective date. Therefore,         at the         close of business on May 30, you are to      take a complete inventory         of all packages of 20s in your possession bearing Maryland state tax stamps. This inventory must be in this       office before June 5   so  we         may remit the tax due to the state.         If your territory includes another state in addition to Maryland and you are working in that state on May 30, you should not, of course, have any Maryland taxed merchandise on hand. However, you should inform us by letter to this effect.         The quantity of 20s reported on your inventory should be multiplied by 4 cents and this amount should be deducted from your Expense Account. Our Tax Department will remit the same amount to the State of Maryland.         Beginning on the effective date, you are to seil all merchandise in your possession at the new increased prices.         Please retain this letter as proof of the fact that the new tax rate has been complied with in the event you are questioned by an agent of the State Tax Commission. 683480 DUCED FROM B&W WEB SITE"

The answers have been prepared ae responses by all of the Companies that are parties to the settlement, thus they reflect a joint industry response rather than the iresponse of only one Company or a personal response by me. Bach of the Cigarette manufacturers has determined to rejipond to Senator Kennedy' s question individually and individual Company responses to those .quecrions will be delivered today or tomorrow to you and to Senator Kennedy.             I personally regrat the ielay that has been entailed in responding to these questions. I would have hoped that responses could have been completei earlier than now. The attention that members of the Committee have paid to this matter is deeply appreciated. I hope that the tardiness. of the responses has not excessively complicated the work of the Committee.

Box 12548 Austin, Texas 78711-2548         Re: State of Texas v. The American Tobacco Co.' et al. Dear Harry:         1 write on behalf of the SettUng Defendants in the above action, This will confirm my conversation with you of yesterday moming regarding the Status of Final Apptoval in this action,         As 1 explained to you, as a result of Kenneth J. Chesebro's apparcntly tünely filing of a notice of appeal in this action, the Settling Defendants cannot at this time instmet the Escrow Agent to rclcase the firnds it is holding. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(3), H[i]f one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the fnst notice was filcd"". Mr. Chesebro's notice of appeal was filed on August 24, and thus the 14-day period specificd                   ^ by Rule 4(aJ(3) will expirc at the end of September 8,1998 (September 7 is a federal                     o^t holiday).                                                                                                 oo                                                                                                                                               ro                                                                                                                                               •Ös                                                                                                                                                «Mj"

September 2, 199S Page 2                               The Settling Defendants are unable to take the risk that — were they to consent now to the release of the escrowed funds -- a second putative appcllant might thereafter (but on or before September 8) file a notice of appeal in this action and persuade an appellate court that Mr. Chesebro was in fact a ""party” within the meaning of Rule 4(a)(3)> with the result that by Operation ofthat Rule the second appellant’s appeal would be timely.                               Accordingly, if - as the Settling Defendants hope - no further appeals are filed in this action on or before September 8, the Settling Defendants will promptly thereafter instract the Escrow Agent that Final Approval has occurred and that the appropriate funds may be released from escrow. Any aigncd escrow instruction that you may already have received should be held by you until further instruction fiom us.                               In addition, this letter also serves to confirm our mutual understanding that the CourPs August 28,1998 Order does not require release of the escrowed funds in the absence of the Settling Defendants5 written consent to the release of those funds.                         cc:       Arthur   Golden                                 Hill Marshall Cary Patterson Steve Patton Richard Verheij 83824675"

Dear Mr. Orandeyi In aocordance with your request, following are liatad our present commitnents for our current advertiseaent and a schedule of the time required for the propoaed ohangea in sach aediun. Our advertising agency ia now reworking the auggeated ad for nevapapers which we hope to be abla to aend to the engravera by this Friday, Februai^r 7th. In thla oase, the plates would be ehipped to all newenapere during thw warly part of next week. Accordingly, our current ad ehould not appear in prlnt eubeequent to February 13th. Although we are planning to work the «Jgravera ovar the weekend, it would be ieposalble to be esrtaln of aay aarlletr date. The one sxoeption to thla date in prlnt ia tha isaue of Lifa nagasine which will appear February 19th, dated February 2Uth. At thla raonent, we are two weeks paat oloeing, and it ia not poaaible to cancel or change the Insertion» Thla is, howevsr, the only national nagasine coanitawnt we have at the present tine which cannot ba changed. In telerlsion, ve will rewrlte the live conraarcials for the Mika Wall&ce Show to ccnfoni with our diaousaiona of yestarday, startlng with next week'a telecaat. Tha filned oonaerolals fcr our apot achedule, however, cannot be reahot untll February 18th and IPth. Tha threatened strika of the Scroen Actor'a Quild on March lat has compelled all advertlsers to erspare a atookpila of filned comnercials during the nonth of Fabruary. Therefore, there are no atudio faollltlee available during thla entlre nonth. Fortunately, ln antlclnation of our possible neede in this direction, we oonnitted ourselves over a weak ago for a atudio on the iBth and 19th."

This communication reports the twelve ether soluble components identified so far. A list of Maillard reaction related Compounds from literature review is also included. Further Separation and characterization of flavor components in the ether extract and possible flavor precursors (e.g., Amadori compounds) in the aqueous fraction will be reported later.                                         MATERIAL AND METHODS              Ether Extraction              To a 30-g sample of reaction ""A"" mixture was added 300 ml of methanol/ water (70/30). The sample was mixed thoroughly and filtered with suction. White crystals retained on the filter paper were identified as amino acid valine. The methanol in the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure. The sample was then extracted with 100 ml of diethyl ether four times.              The aqueous fraction was saved for further analyses. .The combined ether layers were washed with 50 ml of NaCl-saturated water two times. Ten grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate was added to the ether extract followed by filtration. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to remove ether.              Gas Chromatography with Sensory Evaluation              The ether extract was chromatographed on a 60 meter glass capillary column of 12% Carbovax 20M in a Perkin-Elmer gas Chromatograph (Model 900) equipped with an exit port for organoleptic evaluation of part of the column effluent,              Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry              Aliquots of the ether extract were also analyzed using a Finnigan 4021 GC/MS/ Data System (Environmental Consultants, Inc.) in an electron impact mode. Fragmentation of the capil-lary gas Chromatographie effluents in the ion source was followed by repetitive scanning (1-3 sec/scan) of the entire mass ränge. The relative abundance of each fragment was recorded on a Computer disc. Mass spectral Identification was carried out by Computer reference library matching and/or manual interpretation.

"Tobacco800";"kef61f00-page2_2";"NextPage";"RESULTS It has been proposed that the Amadori compounds (the Intermediate sugar-amino acid complex from Maillard reaction3) upon thermal degradation would give flavor compounds such as furans, furanones, pyranones, pyrroles, pyrazines, etc. The sweet flavor compounds identified so far in the ether extract (Table I) belong to these categories. Figure 1 gives the mass spectal total ion chromatogram of the ether extract. Table II gives a list of flavor compounds related to Maillard reactions as a result of literature review of pertinent studies. The possibility of the presence of Amadori compounds in the aqueous fraction of the reaction ""A"" mixture Is being investigated. Nevertheless, application of Amadori compounds instead of the volatile flavor compounds (produced upon pyrolysis) may prove to be a better approach to impart Maillard reaction-type aroma to tobacco smoke,             (Jf£!                                   vu ^         —                 T.

International Corporate Center 555 Theodore Fremd Avenue Rye, NY 10580 Re: ULT/LT Model Development for Selective Binding Dear Susan: Attached are my corrections to the Simmons Tar level classifications that you sent to us. Since MRD recently audited the brand information on the database, we should use the tar level classifications on the database. Hopefully, this recategorization of the tar levels will bring the percentage of fall flavor smokers up closer to 38%. According to our latest MSA data, about 38% of the category is fall flavor and the remainder is low tar (49%) and ultra low tar (13%). There are a few newer brands missing from the 1991 Simmons information. Most of these are franchise brands (Bull Durham, Misty, Montclair, Riviera). This is not really an issue since we would not want to target our franchise brands for Carlton selective binding any way. The competitive brands that are missing are as follows: Merit Ultima, Saratoga, Savannah, Savvy and Sterling. Of these, Merit Ultima is the only brand that is a ULT fall revenue target for Carlton.  del should prioritize fall revenue ULT/LT brands. We have seen  SIX STAMFORD FORUM P.O. BOX 10380  STAMFORD CONNECTICUT 06904-2380  from our NOTS data that 96% of Carlton inswitchers come from full revenue brands. We may want to weight tar level as well. 47% of the inswitchers come from low tar brands and 30% from ULT brands.  TELEPHONE: 203 325 4900 FACSIM1LE: 203 352S164 970548586 PRODUCED FROM B&W WEB SITE"

Diruclor of Mediä Rcilatlons 202/457-4RS6  April 7, 1980  Mr. Max Frankel  Editor of Editorial Page  New York Times  229 West 43rd Street  New York, New York 10036  Dear Mr. Frankel:  Unfortunate ly, your March 2 7 news report on a study by California researchers who claim to have found that environmental tobacco smoke is harmful’to the health of nonsmokers, oveTlooked the caveats raised by Dr. Claude Lenfant of the National Institutes of Health, whose editorial -- which your story otherwise quoted extensively -- accompanied the study in the New England Journal of Medicine. The same was true of your April 2 editorial, ""Thy Neighbor's Lungs.""  Dr. Lenfant wrote:    ""Generally speaking, the evidence that  passive smoking in a general environment has health effects remains sparse, incomplete and sometimes unconvineing. '* He went on to point out that ""there is no proof as yet that the reported reduction in airways function has any physiological "" or clinical consequences. The study is confined to only one aspect of an issue too complex to be resolved on such a limited basis.""  The conclusions reached by Drs. White and Froeb also are at odds with the latest judgment of the U. S. Surgeon General. His 1979 Report on Smoking and Health, which addressed this issue, found: ""Healthy nonsmokers exposed to cigarette smoke have littie or no Physiologie response to the smoke, and what response does occur may be due to psychological factors.""  Clearly, the California study, which will now be subject to objective and critical review within the scientific community, should not be considered the ""final word:"" For the Times to advocate public policy which would dictate social behavior and discriminate against over a third of. the adult population on the basis of this study, seems highly premature and totally out-of-character.

The total expenditure for the First Quarter Minneapolis/ St. Paul activity was $22,000. The Milwaukee activity is also estimated to cost $22,000. Since there was a rate increase in April, we do not anticipate another increase before the end of our schedule in August.

I am pleased to enclose a Statement describing policies of The Council and a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported. Our application procedure entails a mandatory two-step process. First, a short preliminarv inauirv is sent to members of the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluate it for scientific merit and for ""fit"" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. If the Committee’s review vote is positive, you will b& provided with forms and instructions for completing a full application. In the event you receive an award, The Council will consider up to two annual renewals on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications.        The Council operates two application cycles per year and accepts preliminarv inouiries year-round; the date of receipt by CTR determines the cycle in which the proposai is evaluated. Spring, cycle - any inquiry received between March 16 and September 15 and encouraged by the Executive Committee may be submitted as a full application by November 30.       Fall cycle - inquiries received between September 16 and March 15 and encouraged by the Committee may be submitted as full applications bv May 31:  Cycle  Preliminary Inquiry   Deadline for   Notification Activation    Arrival at CTR    Full Application     Date     Date        Spring: Mar 16 - Sep 15          Nov 30       Early May   Jul 1        Fall   Sep 16 - Mar 15          May 31       Early Oct   Jan 1       The format for the preliminary application is as follows: 1. 2.  3.       A three page narrative summary. This should contain a synopsis of the proposed project including relevant background material, its present Status and goals, a brief outline of the research and its impact. The summary should end with a sentence indicating the anticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate of the anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three page limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature citations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the proposai, they must be accommodated within the three page limitation. Two page curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal Professional level coilaborators (the NIH format is quite acceptable). Again, the page limit is strictly enforced; only two pages per investigator are forwarded to the Committee.       One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought.                               ^----.

This measure, Assembly Bill 7139, seeks to prevent tobacco use by minors other things, banning all cigarette advertising with the exception of ads thai newspapers or magazines. This proposal is ill-conceived and potentially destructive to my industry, w thousands of people in New York State. Studies both abroad and in the U have determined that cigarette. advertising plays a minimal role in an indivic to smoke. Peer influence, and the influence of parents and older siblings, i: dominant factor. Banning advertising, therefore, will not affect the inciden by youths. Besides being ill-suited to achieve its stated purpose, this proposal is uncor Since the 1970's, the courts have ruled that commercial speech is protectec First Amendment. Unfortunately, by the time the courts get around to ove measure, the economic damage will already have been done to my industry others.

Each of the cigarette manufacturers has determined to respond to Senator Kennedy's question individually and individual Company responses to those questions will be delivered today or tomorrow to you and to Senator Kennedy.            I personally regret the delay that has been entailed in responding to these questions. I would have hoped that responses could have been completed earlier than now. The attention that members of the Committee have paid to this matter is deeply appreciated. I hope that the tardiness of the responses has not excessively complicated the work of the Committee.  co  Os!  On  ro  cn  -P*  cn  cn MGK/tv"

Whitaker:                  v                 r; • ,             Referring to Mr. Haberkern»s note of August 5 regarding current prices of Com and Cane Sugars, aocording to our oaloulations, Cane Sugar will cost us less to use than Com Sugar on Cigarette to»-bacco. Approximately 100 lbs. of Corn Sugar are requiredto replace 75 lbs. of Cane Sugar in oigarette tobacco with equal quality results. Comparison of cost: 100 lbs.    Corn  Sugar  at $6.65 cwfc 75 lbs.         Cane Sugar at 7*50 owt                               Difference in cost  ——----------------—   1,00             Since we are using 500,000 lbs. Com Sugar per month on cigarettes, a saving of $5,000 per month oan be realized by ohanging to Cane Sugar.             On smoklng tobacco. which is sold by weight, Corn Sugar apparently is cheaper to use. Corn Sugar        contains 17% moisture    and               . Cane Sugar contains l£%.                                                                   I            100 lbs.     Corn Sugar                * 85 lbs. dry   weight at oost of  $6.65 /              75 lbs.    Cane Sugar                es 74 lbs. dry  weight at oost of   5.63 j                  Difference          9  lbs, gain          at  oost of 1.00 I            9 lbs. dry weight is äquivalent      to 10|               lbs, weight    at 14% * moisture content (whioh is P.A. moisture value).           Therefore, 10| lbs. at cost of 1.00 dollar amounts to 9i# PQr 1b* and will be sold at prioe of P.A. which, at 80$Tper Ib., will amount to a gain of 10£ x (80-9&) or $7*50 for every 100 lbs. of Com Sugar used in P.A. Since we use approximately 200,000 lbs. Cora;Sugar per month in P.A., total savings by using Corn Sugar amounts to$15,000 per month.             We are using approximately 500,000 lbs. Corn Sugar per month in all brands. If we substitute Cane Sugar for all of the Com Sugar used in cigarettes, only 200,000 lbs, Corn Sugar will be required per month in other brands. We have 1,050,000 lbs. Corn Sugar on hand or 5 months based on this use. However, we think it would be better to replace only 50% of the Corn Sugar in cigarettes at this time and later make a further reduotion since it is our polioy to ' make ohanges gradually. Also, if later on prioe oontrols are taken off of Cane Sugar, we may find that Com Sugar would be oheaper to use/.l By reducing Corn Sugar only 50% in cigarettes at this time, then v 550,000 lbs. of Corn Sugar will be required per month. /  $6.65   5.6? 50151 541?"

Gardner, Ph.D,   Scientific Director   The Council for Tobacco Research   110 East 59th Street   New York, New York 10022   Dear Doctor Gardner:   I am writing this letter to accompany a grant application by Dr. Bruce Woda that he is submittlng to The Council for Tobacco Research. The application is entitled ""Cell Surface Mernbranes, Integral Membrane Proteins and Cytoskeleton in Lympho-cytes from Young and Old Rats,” and is concerned with some fundamental problems in antigen recognition and tumor surveillance.   The Council for Tobacco Research allows a 15 percent overhead on all its grants that are awarded. If the Council shall consider Dr. Woda’s grant favorably and make an award, neither this Institution nor he would be able to accept it, because of the small 15 percent overhead. The overhead at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation for 1979 has been calculated at 40.5 percent. This is a relatively low figure for an academic Institution and certainly for a commercial ‘Institution. The policy of our institution is that all overhead must be paid since we are a non-profit, private Organization and do not have the means to take up the difference between the allowed overhead and the real overhead. Certainly, Dr. Woda does not have 25 percent of his request, approximately $15,000, to pay this difference, I would appreciate that if this grant finds favor with The Council for Tobacco Research and is awarded some means may be found to reimburse Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation for the difference between your allowed overhead and the actual overhead, or approximately 25 percent additional.   I am submitting this letter with this application so that it can be presented to the Council as a formal request for consideration. Sincerely yours,   Joseph D. Feldman, M.D. Department of Immunopathology   JDF/g   Enclosure                                            50140083"

Judge Lorillard 666 Fifth Ave. New York, NY 10103 Dear Mr. Judge: 1 have been informed that the bill containing the Rose amendment has cleared the joint Congress-Senate Conference Committee with the amendment in a somewhat modified form. My information is that the references to pesticides have been deleted but that the dock-side grading/inspection proposals remain essentially as we originally saw them. This then eliminates the crisis Situation with respect to the pesticide lists. However, I feel certain that we have not heard the end of that issue and that it will probably be revived with new vigor a year or two down the road. Therefore, I think that it would be unwise for the Industry Technical Committee to stop its work short of the goals suggested in Horace Kornegay's original letter to the committee chairman of September 26, 1983. I think that there are several steps which the committee can take to ensure that the Tobacco Institute and the Industry in general is much better prepared to respond the next time a similar proposai is put forward. First, I think that the committee should set up some mechanism by which our current list of world-wide pesticide materials can be kept current both with respect to those used in various countries and the regulatory Status of each in this country. Second, I think that the committee should carefully monitor the Status of those approved (registered) materials which are cur-rently being reconsidered under RPAR (rebuttable presumption against registration) so that our respective suppliers worldwide can be immediately informed if the registration of a particular material is revoked in the U.S. Third, I think that the committee should critically review the data available and Chemical structures of the other materials so as to be able to make good guesses about which ones may pose Problems in the future. 50338 6298"

H. judge Page 2 ■ November 22, 1983  Then, having accomplished these things, I think that the TI should contact such organizations as the Tobacco Association of the U.S. (TAUS) and the Leaf Tobacco Exporters' Association (LTEA) with the proposal that they contact the respective govern-ments of the tobacco exporting countries and ask that these governmcnts be prepared to arrange for some sort of official certificatdon that no pesticides unacceptable- for use in the U.S. have been used in producing the tobacco being exported to the U.S.  1 fully realize that what I have proposed is a large undertaking requiring the continuing cooperation and effort of a lot of people, but I think that if started now, it can be accomplished in time to be ready for the next crisis or even perhaps in time to avert another crisis on this particular subject.

It is, however, a most sincere protest which is reflective of the dis-may shared by a great many of my fellow commuters.          Since the day Conrail arbitrarily instituted its ""one smoking car per train"" policy, we smokers have been subjected to unwarranted discomfort every evening on your trains to Westchester. Every available seating space is taken and there are inevitably dozens of standees. Since we are paying the same fares as nonsmokers, I believe this discriminatory lack of service is completely unwarranted.          My understanding is that the railroad announced it had decided to reduce smoking accommodations to one car per train based upon a survey which showed that 80% of its passengers opted for non-smoking cars. In view of all the published research which consistently confirms that approximately 40% of our adult population are smokers, I strongly doubt the accuracy of the railroad's survey. I, for one, and I know I speak for a great number of my harassed and deprecated fellow passengers who enjoy smoking, vir ge that Conrail re-evaluate its arbitrary seating allocations. Or is there a future plan for second-class prices for our current second-class treatment?                                               Sincerely yours, Mr. Richard F.

A preparative cation exchange Chromatographie procedure was modified to separate the amino acids, AutoAnalyzer equiproent was used to construct a post-column ninhydrin reaction unit to monitor amino acids eluted from the column, Levels of the residual amino acids determined are as follows: valine (1.5%), aspartic acid (0.45%), phenylalanine (0.18%), glutamic acid (<0,03%), proline (<0,07%), glutamine (<0.03%), and histidine (<0.03%). Introduction METCAL is a commercial flavoring mixture of the Maillard reaction type*, which is generally prepared by heating sugar(s) and amino acid(s) in mixture. The starting amino acids in METCAL were aspartic acid, valine,                                                              2 phenylalanine, glutamic acid, proline, glutamine, and histidine . Tn literature, three categories of analytical methods have been used to deternine levels of amino acids in various samples: ion exchange chromato-graphy, gas chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid analyzers and various improved procedures of ion exchange chromatography are so far the most videly used methods. In fact, modern amino acid analyzers incorporate advantages from both ion exchange chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. ln gas Chromatographie determinations of amino acids, samples have to be deriva-tized to increase volatility. Since acid-catalyzed esterification could hydrolyze and convert glutamine to glutamic acid, these gas Chromatographie methods would give only the sum of glutamine and glutamic acid^. High performance liquid chromatography which employs reversed phase or ion-paired principles for amino acid analysis still needs better                                                              62033G738"

For our study, a prepa-rative cation exchange Chromatographie procedure for isolatin of sugar-amino acid complexes was modified for the Separation of the seven starting amino acids, since an in-house amino acid analyzer was not available; and the Product Department requeeted that this sample not be analyzed by an outslde laboratory. Results and Discussion Leucine (5 mg, the internal Standard) was added to a 2-g portion of METCAL, and the sample was applied to a cation exchange colutnn (H+ form) . After washing with water to remove unbound material, the column was eluted with 7 lf NH^OH to give the bound material, which was then freeze-dried to give a residue of 346.1 mg. This material contained the amino acids from METCAL and leucine. A 60 rag aliquot of this sample was chromatographed on Na+ form cation exchange res in (see Appendix for experimental details) , Figure 1 (Panel A) shows the chroraatogram of the bound material (amino acid fraction) from METCAL, in which aspartic acid, valine, and phenyl-alanine were the major residual amino acids. Two unknown peaks were observed, The first unknown peak eluted between valine and leucine. The second unknown peak eluted at 15.5 hr. These unknown peaks did not correspond to any starting amino acid. Figure 1 (Panel B) shows a typical chromatogram of one of a series of Standard amino acid mixtures. These Standard amino acid mixtures contained a fixed amount of leucine and increasing amounts of the other amino acids. Figures 2-8 shov the Standard calibration eurves. Table I summarizes the results of the analyses. Valine, aspartic acid, and phenylalanine were found to be the major residual amino acids present at 1.52, 0.452, and 0,182 by weight of METCAL, respectively. Glutamic acid, glutamine, and histidine were estimated to be below 0.032 each; and proline was estimated to be below 0.07%.                                          620936739"

The column was then eluted with 0.2 11 sodium citrate buffer pH 3.25 for 5 hours 45 minutes, and then with 0.25 11 sodium citrate buffer pH 5.0 for another 21 hours. Detection of Arolno Aclds by Post-Column Ninhydrin Reaction The amino acids eluted from the column were monitored by a post-column ninhydrin reaction unit, as modifed from a procedure of Ertingshausen, et al5. The unit consists of components from the Technicon AutoAnalyser II System (Technicon Industrial Systems, Tarrytown, NY): a multi-channel peristaltic pump (Pump III), mlxing coils, a thermostated bath, a Colorimeter, and a recorder. A schematic is shown in Figure 9. The peristaltic pump was used to pump (1) buffer to and effluent from the Chromatographie column, (2) reagents into the reaction System, and (3) effluent from the Colorimeter. The air-segmented stream of reagents plus column effluent was fed into the reaction coil which was kept at 95eC in an oil bath. The absorbance was measured at 550 nm.

However, no signlficant difference in preference was seen among Newport KS smokers. Since the goal is to offer a Superior KOOL product relative to Newport, further product improvement work was initiated. Improved modifications include reduction in stem, restructuring of flue-cured and burley grades, processed stem in the form of FC-SDS and a Substitution of peppermint oil. Si—ary 8 Hypothesis 1) Among franchise, one of the improvements (A or B) will be as llkeable or better than Current KOOL KS and, 2) Among Newport smokers, one of the improvements (A or B) will be superior over Current KOOL KS. Likeability and preference ratings will be suported with improvements in less Irritation, more smoothness and better tobacco taste. Through product improvement efforts, which have been confirmed through Dupont testing, it is recormended that: 1)   Candidate ""A"" and ""B"" be tested versus Current KOOL KS in    a round      robin fashion     among franchise smokers, and 2)   Candidates ""A""   and “B"" be tested versus Current among Newport      KS and other     Menthol (Salem    and  Marlboro) KS smokers.                                   same except ""A"" contains FC-WTS     and  ""B* contains Proposal                                                                         PACK BOTTOM CODE £ #212 - 1144 CARTONS         CANDIDATE ""AM W/WTS KS UNMASKED #232 - 1144 CARTONS         CANDIDATE ""B"" H/SDS KS UNMASKED   ISöO #282 - 4fr» CARTONS CURRENT KOOL KS UNMASKED 80360 80360 80360                                       465855335"

We agreed to the following:               • Not mail either possible nixies or non-standardized addresses and increase our mail quantity (if possible).                • Mail just non-standardized addresses but not possible nixies. This still gives us a slight lift in response rate and we only lose about 6.3% of our responses.                In addition, let’ s consider assigning more than one mail code to a mailing where we are testing a lot of lists. This way we can track nixie rate by list segment which can provide some valuable information. We can discuss this as we get into pulling lists for a mailing.

It is my feeling that the trip was well worthwhile, and I am quite favorably inpressed with the program which is being undertaken there. Under different circumstances, I would have serious misgivings about the ultiraate value of such an undertaking, but with the guidance of Bob Griffith and the Tobacco and Health Research Institute, I feel that some valuable and practical Information will be generated. As                 I am sure you are aware, all too often in the past some very fine investigators have undertaken research in extremely complicated areas like tobacco without a realization of the complexities of the problem, and have, consequently, expended much time, effort and money to no meaningful end. The past several years of experience in tobacco and smoke research at the University, and the advice and help available from * outside sources, should prevent this sort of thing from happening here.                                                   ~                      I am sure that everyone privileged to attend the Conference is looking forward to hearing of the results of the programs now underway, or proposed. If I, personally, or if we as a Company can be of assistance to the program, we will be pleased to give whataver help is possible.

(sec minutcs of the Forschungsrat-meeting 12/16/00, p. 10) By reading the remarks on this prospectivc study, one gets the Impression that Lhc dccision to start this study has only temporarily been postponed but not finally. Thus» the following comments appear appropriatc: - The Statement that this study can bc a valnable too* to develop a ""less harmful cigarette'* could be undemtood to imply that the cigarettes produced ot present do have harmful effect on smokers.   This is undcsirable. - The costs for this study are astronomicalJy high: 2b Million DM/ycar; especially when one consitlers that costs for scientific supervision, scientific Consultants, collecling and evaluating 1 the obtained data are not included. • The proposed coopcration with the Austrian Social Security Administration will certainly require some second thoughts bccausc the attltude of the Austrian govemment is totally anti-smoking and any results are likely to be lntcrprotcd in that vein. • Further consideration should bc given to the fact thnt Ccrnan and American life-styJo, consumption patterns and diot are not comparablc. Thuo, an important Impulse by Consulting the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute cannot be cxpcctcd.                        - Also quostions conceming shlftu of probnnds (e.g, by moving) and the unrostficted use of personol health dein (in order to   be in nccorduncc with the German law for the protection of individual dnta) should be invcnligotod prior to making ony cofnmitt.vnt to    nuch a study                                                                     0.

WorrelT^                   Evaluation:     CIM* 1977»  No.  11                                   LOW SIDESTREAM PRODUCT. Freddie W. feest        The experiments upon which CIM, 1977, No. .11 was based were exploratory and are described in RDM, 1972, No. 20. The results obtained in the labora-tory indicate that whole tobacco and stems can be ground, extracted, homogenized, molded, dried, and cast into a rigid, smokable rod with acceptable taste, weights and pressure drops. Preliminary smoke analyses of handmade (Laredo filter ciga-rette maker) cigarettes show a 25-42% reduction in FTC ""tar"" compared to WINSTON.  The cast rod smolders slowly with concomitant increase in puff number and appears, from visual inspection, to give a low sidestream smoke which is very attractive from the ""social aspects of smoking"" viewpoint.        The processes used to produce this cigarette are all straightforward pro-  cedures in the laboratory. Producing the cigarette on a commercial scale would -------------------  necessitate development of new manufacturing techniques. The steps involved are (on a laboratory scale):        1} Medium-grade tobacco and stems are ground to a 16 to 20-mesh.        2) The ground tobacco is extracted with hot water or water and methanol.        3) The extract is concentrated and the tobacco reconstltuted with the               extract serving as a binder.        4) Rods are molded from the reconstituted slurry, dried, and reequilibrated               to 60£ humidity.        5) Cigarettes are made on a hand cigarette maker and tipped.  Most of the steps could be easily adapted from existing methods used in the factory. The mol ding of the rods into cigarettes would require new manufac-turing processes.        The processes of concentrating the extract and drying the swollen tobacco rods are energy expensive. Changes in manufacturing techniques would be needed to produce the cigarette on      a     commercial scale. There are losses in grinding  and    handling which would have   to be minimized.      ..These expenses could be offset by the following features:        1) The method produces     a    rod of swollen tobacco which might reduce the               need for tobacco    expanded by other means,    e.g., Freon    11. 2) The higher puff number may make a shorter tobacco rod feasible. 3) Medium grade tobacco (44X) makes a better product than high grade tobacco (SFX). 4) Burley stems improve the product.

It is hereby proposed that the 510 billion up*front payment be allocated according to the average market capitalization of the individual Companies over the May 16,1997 to September 3,1997 period.            This period is deemed of sufficient length to iron out any potential distortioos that could affect individual Companies, whilst also being responsive to RJR’s request to avoid the specific period during which its stock price was the subject of speculative maneuvera. The May 16,1997 date reflects the day agreement in principte was reached on the use of market capitalization for the purpose of allocating the up-from payment.

Broughton, Goldstone, Tisch, Giercr September 8,1997 Page 2  BEST  COPY UST’s market capit&lization will be the base for the smokeiess tobacco industry’s total participation to the up-front payment. This will allcviate the burden on the smaller players and thereby assure their participation and support. All other payments will be altocatcd according to market share inclusive of smokeiess and roll-your-own tobacco. With regard to the smokeiess tobacco industry’s participation, and in an effort to cater for this industry’s specific characteristics, it is proposed that a Standard can/pack of smokeiess product will be deemed the equivalent of one pack of 20 cigarettes for the purposes of calculating individual market shares. It is suggested that this industry’s participation be equal to 30.1 cents per Standard can/pack of smokeiess product. An assessment of 11 cents per pack of dry snuff will be tevied on this segmem given its particular characteristics. Attachment l details the assumptions used to derive the suggested assessments. With regard to the roll-your-own industry, it i$ suggested that a weight-based convenior. factor be used to convert tobacco into cigarette equivalents. According to the Economic Research Service of the USDA, total 1996 roltyour-own volume was 4.9 million pounds, or the equivalent of 3.1 billion cigarettes. Clcarly, BAT needs to confirm these numbers and the conversion factor of l .53 lbs. per thousand cigarettes. It is proposed that the roll* your-own industry be asscssed on the basis of S0.11 per equivalent of a pack of 20 cigarettes. i.e., $0.275 per 40 gram pouch.

The second to attribute type (1 ss descriptive,              2 = evaluative)         3. The third to■preference position (1 = before attributes, 2 = after attributes).

Attributes — of which there are 10 plus the overall -are to be broken for:        the total, by sex, by age, by tar level, and by preference (prefer A, prefer B, no preference). Also, for each attribute, r's are to            be calculated between preference (1 = prefer A, 0 = no preference, -1 = prefer B) and difference between attribute ratings (A-B). These r's should reflect the exfcent to which attribute ratings reflect the individual' attempt to attribute characteristics to the products which justify his preference. 2.

Here we would not be interested in significant main effects, per se, but rather in significant interactions. Also, do a series of ""F"" tests on each product for each attribute in which the variance associated with descriptive attributes is compared to that associated with evaluative attributes, And finally, within each presentation type, do a 2-way analysis of variance for each attribute in which cigarettes and replications are treated as the independent variables. The analyses described here are the ones that we definitely need.. We also, however, want you to perfonn any additional analyses necessary for you to meaningfully Interpret the findings, We want to be provided with a data tape in which individual1 s data are recorded identically, in card image form.

Comments on a Nature article reporting the role of ß2 subunits of acethylcholine receptors in mediating dopamine release in the midbrairt of mice by nicotine, 2. Transcriptfrom BBC World Service Radio regarding the article above. 3. Comments on a Nature article reporting ""a ceilular basis for reports that the first cigarette of the day is the most pleasurable\ Please forward thi^ information to Drs. Etiis and Guliotta and appropriate colleagues. Note on “2."": ■   Dr    Changeux is the last author of the article by Picciotto et aL *   Dr,   Changeux describes “positive action of nicotine"", namely, as a          cognition enhancer     as   well as an anxiolytic (page 3; there are obvious mistakes in the transcript such as     describing an anxiolytic to ""increase"" anxiety). Since ß2-lacking               mutant mice show     higher ability of learning than the wild-type (see ""1."" attached), it can be argued that the subunit functions as an “inhibitor* of learning. In this case the ability of nicotine to faciiitate ieaming cannot be explained. • Dr. Changeux appears to think that there are several levels of “addiction” (page 4).

As I understand it, CTR had agreed that, because of both the Labor Day holiday and the site visit, we should fly in on Sunday 6 September and depart Saturday 12 September. We did in fact arrive one day sooner and, in order to compensate, departed; immediately after the SAB meeting on Friday 11 September. Accordingly my expense account covers that complete period and I trust you will find it in order. I have attached all possible receipts and have not included meals taken outside the hotels, including one where I entertained Dr. Gonzalez from NCI in order to quiz him about the application from Dr. Quattrochi. I am a little uncertain as to the guidelines for expenses and would be grateful for your future guidance. I hope all is well with Mr. Gertenbach and all his Staff and let me thank you all for your kindness and hospitality. In order to expedite matters, would you please call me if you have any queries or Problems associated with making the reimbursement directly to my Citibank account.

J.   Bluhm                   Although our strain of A^ oxydans has the unusual ability to tolerate and hydroxylate nicotine, its identifying characteristics are the same as given for that species in Bergey's Manual. Therefore, we have referred to the Manual in the text of the application instead of including the long list of characteristics. This appears to be common practice in patents already issued.                   Yes, we believe Figures I and II are important in the application.               The amount of inoculum (Figure I) required to obtain a high yield in a reasonable time is critical and is proportional to the concentration of nicotine in the medium. A relatively short incubation time (Figure II) was required to complete the fermentation of various concentrations of nicotine. The above facts are necessary documentation of the Claims . proposed in this disclosure.                   We have written in 4 Claims to replace those in the copy returned to us. These Claims point out the 4 bases for clalming protection which are:                   1.  Furification of nicotine to permit fermentation of concentrations up to 10%.                   2.  Use of a specific strain    of A. oxydans.                   3.  Yields up to 93.9% after    incubation for less' than 72 hours.                   4.  The use of a non-sterile    nicotine containing medium without     danger                       of contamination.               Claims 1 and 3 could be separated into two each as follows, if 0esirable.                   (1) a. Purification of nicotine to permit its fermentation in concentrations in excess of 0.05%.                       b.

"Tobacco800";"njk79d00-page02_1";"FirstPage";"October 19, 1979 Ms. S. A. MacKinnon Subject:    SALEM Full  Flavor  Prime Prospect Recommendation Purpose Seek approval to a refined prime prospect definition for SALEM Full Flavor. Background The Product Group identified to Management a concern that the cur-rent 1980 media plan under delivered the target audience vs. total adults. This shortfall resulted primarily from a very broad target age demographic of 18+. Additionally, the original composition of the prime prospect (50% current franchise/50% segment profile) did not recognize switching data. This omission understated the impor-tance in the prime prospect definition of males and young adults who evidenced superior switching performance on SALEM King's. Therefore, the definition of the prime prospect was reexamined to appropriately acknowledge switching performance and improve the effectiveness of the media plan against the target audience. Recommendation Revise sex and age as follows in the prime prospect profile for King's/100 1s combined:                        Prime Prospect Definition Recommended            Current                       -            Sex:      54% Men                52% Men                     *5^            Age:      18-34 (52%)            18+                                                         Note: See Exhibit I for complete prime prospect definition. Rationale 1. King's prime prospect adjusted to reflect switching performance ."
"Tobacco800";"njk79d00-page02_2";"NextPage";"Ms. S. A. MacKinnon Page Two October 19, 1979 1.   Continued:      - Net switching indicates superior performance axnong males and young adult smokers (18-34). See Exhibit II.      - Slight male skew increase is consistent with current franchise profile. See Exhibit III.      - Target segment and switching profile weighted 70% to re-flect importance of males and younger adults. See Exhibit 2.   100's prime prospect remains unchanged to acknowledge importance of the older, female smoker in our current franchise.      - Reflecting switching performance would overstate the importance of males and young adults beyond that already reflected in target segment profile. Overemphasis would result in media delivery away from our source of business.      - Target segment and current franchise continue to be weighted equally. See Exhibit IV. 3. Weighting of King's and 100's for combined prime prospect profile is unchanged.      - Weighting of King's (67%)/100's (33%) is proportional to volume. 4. Results in greater effectiveness of media plan delivery.      - 52% of impressions now delivered to target audience. Revised prime prospect profile retains Brand's defensive posture while recognizing an offensive opportunity against males and young adults. This results in increasing the effectiveness of the media plan. Next Steps Approval of the refined prime prospect definition is requested so 1980 media plans can be revised as soon as possible.          III Summary  W. Kenneth Neher WKN:srp"

These will be in the strip form and will be at a moisture content of around 13.0%. The alkaloid contents will be close to the tobaccos that you processed earlier for us.   My immediate needs are for about 50 kg of each of Burley and Flue-cured blends. I would, therefore, appreciate if these quantities could be processed and returned to me at your earliest convenience. Target Alkaloids should be near zero.   Rest of the tobaccos may be processed at your convenience and returned to us during the next three months.   I have plans to send further quantities of tobacco for storage at your end for any future extraction should a need for such extracted tobaccos arise in the near future. We will be in a better position to assess such needs after experimenting with these intial quantities.   There is a degree of urgency on this project because of an anticipated change in product mix in the dornestic market. We thank you for your help and Cooperation. ►                                                  Sincerely,             Burley Blend:          100 kg             Flue-cured Blend:      100 kg             Oriental Blend:         35 kg B.

Unfortunately, three of these submissions - those for Illinois, Indiana, and Montana - cannot be reviewed at this time. First, Fee Payment Agreements have not been executed with respect to these States. Second, the submissions appear to seek reimbursement for costs and expenses incurred by Hagens Berman only. Section 19 of Exhibit O to the Master Settlement Agreement expressly provides that the Designated Representative for a         ^            given state shall submit “a Cost Statement,” he., a single Statement, to the Original Participating    ^            Manufacturers.

Thereafter, the Original Participating Manufacturers will consider single, appropriately documented and attested Cost Statements for each of these states, once they have been submitted."

We are required to use the newly published numbers in virtually all our paid consumer directed advertising in the U.S., its territories, and that directed primarily to members or units of U. S. Armed Forces abroad where the advertisement is for a cigarette brand that is identical to that tested by the FTC.           Where we are obligated to use the new FTC results, they should be disclosed in the following format:                          "" mg 'tar',  mg nicotine av. per                          cigarette, FTC Report Jan.

Sherman February 13, 1980 Page 2         (üi) the product featured in the advertising is the export product which has different product specifications from the domestic product. A list of the T/N values for our brands which fall within any of the exceptions in (i) through (üi) above is attached as Exhibit 11. The T/N values for these brands should be reported in our advertising as follows:                "" mg 'tar1,  mg nicotine av. per                Cigarette, by FTC method- "" Inasmuch as the productssold to our U.S. military persormel are identical to the U.S. domestic products, the T/N values reported in the Federal Register should be used except for the values for the following brands which were either not reported or have undergone product changes since the FTC pick-up date:                BEL AIR KS                KOOL Super Lights KS                KOOL Super Lights 100's                                         ?                KOOL Müds KS                                                    :                KOOL Milds 100's                                                7 The T/N values for these brands are given in attached Exhibit III, and must be reported in the above ""by FTC method"" format. The T/N values of the January FTC Report must also be used in those instances where the export and domestic products are identical and where there has been no product change since the FTC pick-up date. The only brands falling withtn this category and their respective T/N values are set forth in attached Exhibit II. The T/N values for these brands should be reported in the ""FTC Report Jan. '80"" format. As you are aware, you must use the T/N values reported in Exhibit II in all our advertising of any style KENT and TRUE brand cigarettes. This is true even for our military advertising of these brands. We shall continue to use our own analysis numbers for these brands Bince Lorillardwas the manufacturer of the product tested by the FTC. These brands must be reported in the ""by FTC method"" format. The critical date for use of the new test results is February 21, 1980. If the regularly scheduled clostng date for cigarette advertisements in any newspaper, magazine, or other periodical is February 21, 1980 or earlier, you may use either the figures from the May 1978 FTC Report or the new January 1980 FTC test results. For such advertising with closing daies after February 21, 1980, you must use the new test results.                                                    660934841"
"Tobacco800";"ogg70f00-page3_3";"NextPage";"Mr. R. F. Sherman February 13, 1980 Page 3 For ""out-of-home"" and ""point-of-sale"" advertisements, you may use either the new or old FTC test results if the advertisement or materials are delivered in final form to the prirrter or are painted or assembled on or before February 21, 1980. Delivery of such advertisements after this date necessitates use of the new test results. As before, the T/N values are not required on ""point-of-sale"" materials which are reasonably expected to be exposed to the public beyond a six-month period. The T/N legend must be in a color, including black or white, clearly contrasting with the color of the background. In so-called ""bleed"" advertisements, or those having a multicolored background, a solid and distinctly contrasting background should be used behind the legend. Where different cigarette varieties have the same brand name and a specific style or variety is not clearly identified as being advertised, the T/N content of all varieties having that brand name must be disclosed in the advertisement. For the sake of summary and emphasis, the new FTC T/N results must be used after February 21, 1980 in all advertisements in the U. S., its territories, or that directed to its Armed Forces overseas where the product advertised is identical in all respects to that reported in the January 1980 FTC test. We shall keep you advised if there are any product changes which would result in new T/N values for that product. This memorandum does not, and is not intended to, answer all your questions relating to the impact of the new FTC test results. There-fore, please contact me if I can be of any further assistance to you in this matter.                                               Very truly yours.

I have reviewed the requirements for the 135 mm polyprop pack film as regards to both the KENT LIGHTS and the KENT PARENT products. for Egypt. Per your Suggestion, we will use the material currently in Egypt to fill our immediate KENT LIGHTS 100 pack film requirements. Future Orders of pack and carton film will depend on a combination of factors such as production volumes of the PARENT product, release of materials held by our original agent in Egypt, and our ability to qualify a film source with Egypt. I will advise of our specific needs as the Situation develops. Thanks for your assistance.

Lorillard Company, Inc.             2525 E. Market Street Greensboro, Horth Carolina             Bear Sir:             This report is to inform you of the results obtained by application of the smoke from cigarettes treated with one percent citric acid to frog cilia.             The treated cigarettes were machine inade from Qld Gold King Size tobacco which had been sprayed with a solution of citric acid in methanol. The citric acid used amounted to one percent by weight of the tobacco sprayed. The methanol was removed from the tobacco by evaporation prior to the making of the cigarettes.

The smoke from these two groups of cigarettes was applied to the frog cilia as preyiously described [May 20, i960]. The average of ten tests with the control cigarettes showed an increase in rate of 6.8 percent at three minutes after exposure, and a decrease of 77 percent at sixteen minutes after exposure. The average of seven tests with the 1$ citric acid treated cigarettes showed an increase in rate of 4-7 percent at three minutes after exposure, and an increase of 20 percent at sixteen minutes after exposure. It will be noted that in a previous report eoneerning the effect of cigarettes treated with ten percent by weight of citric acid, the average effect at the end of     sixteen minutes was an   increase in rate   of nine percent.

It does, hcwever, polnt up the fact that definite numerlcal values can only be assigned after an extremely large amount of data has been accumulated. These differences arise because of the large differences between successive speeimens [cammonly as auch as 100/6]. However, it is feit that sufficient data has new been obtained to confirm the fact that citric acid on tobacco at the one percent level is sufficient to provide the desired effect^ that is, to neutralize the ciliary inhibiting effect of untreated tobacco smoke.""

As you may be aware, the Original Participating Manufacturers (“OPMs”) previously responded to your earlier requests for ;      documents in my letter to Margaret Moses Branch of February 24, 1999. (For your convenience, • * a copy of that letter is enclosed hcrewith.)   J ^                               Section 19 of the New Mexico Fee Payment Agreement provides that if the OPMs         dispute a Cost Statement “the Cost Statement shall be subject to a full audit by examiners to be . appointed by the [OPMs] (in their sole discretion).” The only audit right created by the Fee Payment Agreement is thus the OPMs’ right to conduct a full audit of a Cost Statement that they dispute. The Fee Payment Agreement does not as pari of this audit process provide you with reciprocal rights to an audit or to discovery, whether from the OPMs, their counsel, or from  oo  OJ  Cn  CH  cn o"

Ho Department of Neuro-oncology, Box 100 University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center 1515 Holcombe Houston, Texas 77030 Dear Dr. Ho:        Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of research support. I am pleased to enclose a Statement describing policies of The Council and a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported. Our application procedure entails a mandatory two-step process. First, a short oreliminarv inauirv is sent to members of the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluate it for scientific merit and for ""fit"" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. If the Committee’s review vote is positive, you will be provided with forms and instructions for completing a full application. In the event you receive an award, The Council will consider up to two annual renewals on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications.        The Council operates two application cycles per year and accepts oreliminarv inouiries year-round; the date of receipt by CTR determines the cycle in which the proposal is evaluated. Spring cycle - any inquiry received between March 16 and September 15 and encouraged by the Executive Committee may be submitted as a full aoolidation by November 30.       Fall cycle - inquiries received between September 16 and March 15 and encouraged by the Committee may be submitted as full applications by May 31: Cycle  Preliminary Inquiry   Deadline for   Notification Activation    Arrival at CTR    Full Application     Date     Date        Spring   Mar 16 - Sep 15        Nor 30       Early May   Jul 1        Fall    Sep 16 - Mar 15        May 31       Early Oct   Jan 1       The format for the preliminary application is as follows: 1. A three page narrative summary. This should contain a synopsis of the proposed project including relevant background material, its present Status and goals, a brief outline of the research and its impact. The summary should end with a sentence indicating the anticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate of the anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three page limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature citations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the proposal, they must be accommodated within the three page limitation. 2. Two page curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal Professional level collaborators (the NIH format is quite acceptable). Again, the page limit is strictly enforced; only two pages per investigator are forwarded to the Committee. 3. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought. Sincerely, Arthur D. Eisenberg Encl ADE/mla"

I am writing at this time to reiterate that at no time did I or any other representative of an Original Participating Manufacturer state or “lind” that the Alabama “NPM Statute” satisfies Section tX(d)(2)(B) of the Master Settlement Agreement.

Tucker and I have discussed the advisability of increasing the Propylene Glycol in our cigarettes sent to tropical countries. Mr. Tucker and I feel this would be a wise move, and we also feel you are in entire agreement with this deoision.              Due to humid conditions in tropical countries, tobacco products containing no anti-mold agent are very apt to become musty in a short period of time in such countries.  ___________ Our  experience with Propylene Glycol shows that this material   » has exaSöent anti-mold properties and, in our opinion, cigarettes containing of this material will keep in a sound condition in tropical   countrxee-r^              At present our cigarettes contain Propylene Glycol and 1^6 Glycerine. During the war we used as much as 1^ Propylene Glycol which we believe was partly responsible for the reputation Camels acquired for being sound among the soldiers overseas.

So how do you account for their skepticism?"" Dr. Brandt responded:  ""I think some scientists clearly look for complete Identification of the mechanism before they will accept factors as being causal. As I point out in my testimony, at the present time the exact Physiologie or pathophysiologic mechanisms for cigarette smoking and these illnesses has not been clearly demonstrated.      Less than a month earlier, of course, Dr. Brandt*s. department had issued its annual report on smoking. It stated:         ""Cigarette  smoking is clearly identified as the chief preventable cause of death in our society and the most important public health issue of our time.""      I think you*ll agree Dr. Brandt*s candid concession to Senator Hatch on the state of scientific certainty in the area of smoking and health is in marked contrast to the dogmatic Claims of the governmentts report.      I bring this to your attention because it illustrates problems within TIME’s March 8 four-column article on the Surgeon General's report.      I know that TIME does not automatically accept government pronouncements — it certainly does not in many areas of national concern and should not with respect to health matters. Surely the magazine’s editorial goal is to provide readers with a complete, hopefully unbiased, view of current events.                    03024S21      ünfortunately, that does not seem to be the case when reporting on smoking and health. Coverage in the March 8 article, for example, seemed superficial at best — essentially parroting the government report with no attempt to examine its merits or alternative viewpoints.      Both your New York reporter, Anastasia Toufexis, and your Washington reporter, Jeanne Saddler, had received prior to the release of the Surgeon General’s report, a 102-page document published by The"
"Tobacco800";"pgo51e00-page04_2";"NextPage";"Mr. Ray Cave May 3, 1982 Page 2 Tobacco Institute on the subject of smoking and cancer. The TI report was fully documented and based on the same body of scientific literature which we hope was reviewed by the authors of the government’s report. The TI report, however, was dismissed as ""predictable” in two sentences near the end of a four-column article      Permit me to offer some point-by-point comments:      • The article reported TIME’s own conclusion that nToday smoking is considered a major cause of not only lung cancer but of cancer of the larynx, oral cavity and esophagus, and a contributory factor in the development of malignancy in the bladder, pancreas and kidney."" Yet as our own report demonstrated, eminent scientists still question the smoking/cancer hypothesis for reasons as obvious as that cited in Dr. Brandt’s Senate testimony. Comparison of tobacco consumption figures and lung cancer rates among nations also tax the hypothesis. For the other diseases, close examination of incidence and mortality rates in this country alone reveals many patterns that do not support the hypothesis that cigarette smoking causes them.      The causal theory cannot explain the varied patterns in bladder, oral/pharyngeal and esophageal cancer that have been reported (page 6 of the enclosed copy of our report). Incidence rates for these diseases seem to lack any coherent pattern. They rise, fall or remain stable, depending on the disease, gender and race. Even if one considered the so-called lag period of first exposure to an agent and the clinical appearance of disease, the varied trends still could not be explained by the hypothesis that cigarette smoking is the causal agent. This information is noted on pages 5 and 6 of The Institute report.      • The surgeon general’s assertion, reported by TIME, that tobacco ”is responsible for some 340,000 deaths in this country annually” is based on layers of assumption. It certainly would not stand up to the level of journalistic scrutiny given, for example, to President Reagan’s figures on employment.      It’s interesting to note that the original Surgeon General's report in 1964 rejected the ""excess death” theory:       ""The total number of excess deaths causally related to cigarette smoking in the U.S. population cannot be accurately estimated.” The reason was given at the news Conference when the report was released ”The Committee considered the possibility of trying to make such calculations but it involves making so many assumptions that the Committee feit it should not attempt this...”                  03024922      No one at TIME, or any other news organization, for that matter, bothered to question the accuracy of Dr. Koop’s Charge."
"Tobacco800";"pgo51e00-page04_3";"NextPage";"Mr. Ray Cave May 3, 1982 Page 3      • ""An epidemic (of lung cancer) araong men has existed for years, now it is being repeated among women,"" the Surgeon General claimed. The ""reason"", according to TIME:         ""lung  cancer may take decades to develop, and women began taking up smoking in large numbers only after World War II."" That sounds simple, but this reasoning ignores the fact that the type of lung cancer most prevalent among women (and nonsmokers) is adenocarcinoma — a cell type very weakly associated with smoking. This phenomenon was confirmed in a recent study at the Mayo Clinic. No one bothered to ask the Surgeon General about it.      • On the subject of ""passive smoking"", TIME reported that ""The Surgeon General cites two studies that showed increased risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking women who are married to smokers."" In fact, the report cited three studies. The third and largest, by the American Cancer Society, did not support the hypothesis. The other two studies cited have been vigorously criticized in the scientific literature. At the Surgeon General’s press Conference, Dr. Brandt also said the evidence from the two positive studies ""is not conclu-sive by any Stretch of the imagination."" TIME says the findings ""are considered preliminary.""      Mr. Cave, the government does not have all the answers about smoking and health. No one on this earth knows exactly how a normal, healthy cell becomes cancerous. This rather long letter is written in the hope that TIME, covering the subject of smoking and health in the future, can set an example of depth and objectivity.      Copies of pertinent information, including recent Congressional testimony of just a few of the eminent medical researchers and epidemiologists who question the ""conventional wisdom"" about smoking, are enclosed for your review.

COHEN OF COUNSEL To:    Committee of  Counsel Gentlernen:            Yesterday moming, April 2, Mr. Kornegay and I called on Chairman Engman at the Federal Trade Commission. We had suggested, in making this appointment, that he might care to have Mr, Rosch present. Not only did Rosch tum up, but he also had Eric Rubin, who had taken Mr. Meyer’s place, Terrence Boyle, and one of Chairman Engman's assistants prese.nt,            Our presentation covered three points. The first two may be briefly summarized. The third is a most confus-ing aberration.            1.              We mentioned to the Chairman that we had been originally advised that the Staff report and recommendations would go forward to the Commission about March 11. We were told that we could file a statement to accompany that report, but,that Mr. Rosch insisted that we file the industry statement by March 14. We mentioned that we had leamed that no report had as yet gone forward from the Staff to the Commission.            After noting that the industry was not in a Position to teil the Bureau how to operate, we urged two points: that the Commission review the entire Situation in depth and that we hoped that each Commissioner could at least read the introduction and our recommendations. We renewed the request that if the opportunity presented itself that Mr. Kornegay and Mr. Austern appear at the Commission table to answer questions or to Supplement the Statement. TIMN 0153166"

The questions of Publicity about the compliance investigation were reviewed. The original agreement in 1974 for no Publicity had been fully honored. Since the ANPA Government Relations Committee had scheduled a meeting for March 12, and there had been a great deal of interest generated at least by the several hundred letters Mr. Boyle had addressed to newspapers, Mr. Komegay and Mr. Austern were asked to attend that meeting and give a status report which we did but we had pointed out emphatically that what was presently concerned was a Staff position and not a cte-termination by the Commission. We urged that no Publicity be given. We reported that we did not, and had not yet, given the ANPA our Statement.            We next stated that neither Komegay nor Austern had talked with reporters. Our point was that the publicity had not been generated by the industry. (In a later side discussion following the meeting with the Chairman, Eric Rubin, violently disagreed. He stated th.at he had knowledge of everything that had been said at the ANPA meeting and that in his view it was the industry that had triggered the Publicity.)            As to the billboard people, we pointed out that they were vitally interested, that we knew that they had been visiting the Commission even before the Staff report was before the Commission. We indicated that we could not control what the billboard people would do, or what they might say, or where they might say it.            3. The final point emerged from an almost incom-prehensible letter received by three Companies notifying them that the Commission had granted the request of Consumers Union for access to the 1970 sales data and advertising ex-penditure data contained in the Commission’s files. That letter was captioned with a reference to the 1972 Consent Orders. The Consent Orders of course did not become effective until March 30, 1972. We pointed out to the Chairman that this was a new and confusing Situation, particularly TIMN 0153167"

The Chairman stated that this had been a routine request by Consumers Union, that under the Freedom of Information Act the material had to be supplied, and observed that 1970 data was fairly old.            It was further made clear that this request had not originated with the Staff and had nothing to do with the compliance problem.            Mr. Austern agreed that this was true,- but sug-gested that these materials apparently had been supplied in response to Commission orders and that it was his recollec-tion that the Companies had requested confidential treat-ment. He advised the Chairman that he was satisfied about the lack of relation to the compliance inquiry, but that each of the Companies would have to be free to pursue the matter of confidentiality on an individual basis.            Following the meeting, Mr. George H. Yenowine, the Institute Publications Director, obtained the original request of Consumers Union. A copy of that request is enclosed. It will be observed that Warren Braren, as Associate Director, made the request under date of August 14, 1974. (It will be recalled that Mr. Braren turned up as'an advisor to the Staff at an agency interview on August 21, 1974.) It likewise appears that he asked for PTC Staff studies, and instead was given ""access to 1970 sales data and advertising expenditure data contained in the Commission files."" The Commission letter also suggests that these materials were submitted in connection with the compliance inquiry. This seems to be erroneous.            Mr. Komegay and I have concluded, first, that however confusing this latest episode may be, we ought not to have it obscure or confound the main points involved in the compliance proceeding; second, that raising it with the Chairman will at least lead the Commission to scrutinize any further requests by Mr. Braren; but that the question of whether the confidentiality of the individual Company reports submitted to the Commission in response to its                                                       TIMJV 0153168"

COHEN OP COUNSCL  January 13, 1975 Maurice S. Meyer, Esquire Assistant Director for Compliance Bureau of Consumer Protection Federal Trade Commission Washington, D.C. 20580 Dear Mr. Meyer:         This letter’ relates to your telephone request that we meet with you and your Staff, at 2 p.m. on January 15 next, info’rmally to afford you some indication of the areas of dis-eussion of a possible settlement of the suggested issues as to compliance with the consent cease and desist orders. That discussion will precede the scheduled meeting with Mr. Rosch and. your Staff on January 20. We are writing you in advance to indicate the basic approaches which in our view will have to be considered. We are not, however, in this letter endeavoring to include every detail of the presentation we will make, but we trust that you will have enough to facili-tate our preliminary discussion on January 15.         In our recent continued discussions with counsel for the respondents concerning a possible reasonable settlement, the initial and key emphasis has been on the question of in-suring an adequate and specific basis for avoiding any argu-ments about compliance in the future. In our view, no possible settlement of the present differences of opinion as to what the Order means, and what constituted compliance with it in the past, will serve any useful purpose for the Commission and for the respondents unless what is to be done in the future is precisely determined. Only in that fashion can future arguments be avoided and the resources of the Commission and the respondents not as heavily taxed as they have been over the past eight months.

Meyer, Esquire January 13, 1975 Page Two                     Moreover, it remains the view of the respondents that even though this is a Consent Order, it is still an order of the Commission which must be interpreted as written, and not as more than two years later members of the Staff post hoc suggest it should have been written. If there is ambiguity anywhere in the Order, that ambiguity must be resolved against the background of the negotiations.                     In examining that background, there must be understood our references to the mock-ups submitted to"" the Commission; the understandings with the Staff who negotiated on behalf of the Commission; and the Compliance Reports which were filed in December 1972 as well as the exhibits attached to them which comprehended at least three of the basic questions as to which your Staff now, more than two years later, is ad-vancing novel theories. As to those Compliance Reports, the Commission up to April 197^ communicated nothing to the respondents.                     We also deem relevant the overall performance of the respondents in achieving the objectives of the Order. We re-gard the interpretations of Section G which have been sug-gested as wholly unfounded. You might, for example, refer to the Philip Morris Report of Compliance, of September 1, 1972, which makes it perfectly clear that the Order covered only point-of-sale material larger than 36 square inches delivered in final form to the printer after July 14, 1972.                     In dealing with what is to be done in the future, in order not to generate further or continued controversy, we believe there are three cardinal points.                     The first is that these respondents are not to be held in Violation of the Order so long as the production materials which they or their agencies prepare and distribute to any media a-re in compliance. This was clearly understood through-out the negotiations of the Consent Order. There is simply no other way to operate. As we have repeatedly pointed out, neither magazines nor newspapers were named as respondents.                     Apart from the manifest bias against Cigarette advertising exhibited by you and some members of your Staff during our recent discussions, the type of rigid control over media embodied in some of the positions advanced would have required                                                          TIFL 0526450 TIMN 0165440"
"Tobacco800";"pqw02f00-page07_3";"NextPage";" COVINGTON S. BURLING Maurice S. Meyer, Esquire January 13* 1975 Page Three the diminution or cessation of newspaper advertising. That was clearly not contemplated by the Order and would have been certain to inflict substantial economic loss on the newspaper industry.         Second, the experience of these respondents to date in this investigation makes it imperative that for the future there be agreed upon with the Commission a series of Standard acetates or overlays which are to be used for compliance. (It may be that a settlement will develop separate agreed-upon acetates for magazines, for newspaper usage (other than newspaper Supplements or spectacolor or hi-fi), and for POS usage.) Neither the Commission nor these respondents can effec-tively operate if arguments are to be generated in the future as to minute typographical Variation appearing in particular media.         Third, as to any agreed changes, there must be con-tinued recognition of the need for -realistic lead.times as understood from the very outset and reflected in Paragraph G of the Order.         Nevertheless, in order to settle the present contro-versial questions, without generating further demands upon the resources of the Commission or the respondents, we are pre-pared to discuss with you, and to recommend to the respondents with some confidence as to acceptance, a series of agreements for the future.         As to typography, we are still clear beyond peradven-ture that the Ianguage of Paragraph C.2 specifies leading equivalent to the ""x-height"" of each type size, measured from the bottom of the lower case characters in the first line to the top of the lower case letters in the second line. If this were not true, the Ianguage ""excluding the ascending and de-scending letters"" would make no sense. Obviously, there are neither ascenders or descenders in any ""x-height.""         We are prepared to discuss some reasonable modification in measuring the space between the first line and the top rule and the second line and the bottom rule more than the Order literally requires.

Meyer, Esquire January 13* 1975 Page Four         We do not believe it serves the purpose of the Order to reduce the width of the resulting rectangle. We will demonstrate to you that the suggested literal exhibited to us by your Staff results in narrower rectangles than the Standard acetate now employed by the respondents. We do not know the source of'that so-called Staff literal or the in-structions given for its preparation. We are satisfied that any comparative examination of the Standard acetate will dis-close that the spacing horizontally is far more generous than the Order requires.                           "" '         In this area, we are hopeful that you will understand that these differences of a few type points will hardly com-mend themselves to either the Commission-or any court as the basis for urging that every advertisement prepared since the controlling dates in the Order was in Violation. In view of the insignificance of these typographical issues in achieving the objectives of the Order, we are prepared, as noted, to come to a reasonable accommodation for the future.         As to shrinkage, there is no point in here elaborating that. we are prepared to establish to Mr. Rosch, to the Com-mission--and if ever necessary to any court--that shrinkage was never discussed during the negotiations, that these respondents were never chargeable with controlling newspaper printing, and that shrinkage has not impaired the prominence or legibility of the warning statement.         (Nor do we in our discussions with you need to go through the exercise of demonstrating that since the Standard acetate used in production materials was far wider horizontally than what the Order literally requires, the extent of shrinkage is far less than has been suggested.)         There has, however, been an incredible amount of ex-ploration and discussion of shrinkage. These respondents cannot in the future control the economics of newspaper print-ing that has presently become so acute because of increased newsprint costs. Moreover, Mr. Boyle has,indicated that on your Staff examination virtually all of this shrinkage prob-lem can be dissipated by the respondents, who either slightly or to a substantial extent utilize ROP advertising, using the next largest category in the preparation of production materials for those newspapers. We are prepared to discuss                                              TlFL 0526452 TIMN 0165442"
"Tobacco800";"pqw02f00-page07_5";"NextPage";" COVINGTON & BURLING Maurice S. Meyer, Esquire January 13, 1975 Page Pive that change as part of a settlement. In doing so, the need for a separate agreed-upon ROP newspaper acetate becomes ob-vious, and if that is employed in the production materials sent to newspapers, there can be no further argument about shrinkage.         if newsprint costs lead present Standard 8-column newspapers to change to six columns, which would completely change the economics of newspaper advertising rates which are now measured in vertical agate lines per- column, the requirement of going up one size will not apply to those newspapers who employ that six-column format.         As to point-of-sale materials, it will follow that any modifications for the future made in typography will apply to the warning statement to be used, after adequate lead time, in any POS materials. But in this complicated area, there are a number of key questions which must likewise be resolved. The first has to do with POS materials already in place before any future changes are agreed upon. Your Staff is of course familiar with the fact that by and large the use of POS materials is a rotating practice. with particular brands being pro-moted by these materials over limited periods of time. As to permanent POS items already in place, it was never originally contemplated and no agreed settlement can require that the respondents undertake any responsibility for removing or modi-fying these in thousands of locations. Commission orders operate prospectively and any agreed upon changes must likewise do so.         In a few instances there have been differences as to how one measures the ""advertising display area."" Where a POS item has an irregulär shape, we are prepared to discuss some uniform and simplified method of determining the com-posite area. But in determining what is the ""advertising display area,"" we are not prepared to include either cigarette packs or cartons which are placed in counter display cases. In addition, we are not prepared to consider the in-clusion in that measurement of non-advertising functional Statements, such as ""Welcome"" or ""Thank You"" or Astro turf or other change mat areas.         We have also extensively discussed a few minor items given to retailers which refer generally only to ""cigarettes,"" such as aisle markers which do not refer to any respondent                                              TIFL 0526453 I1\1N 0165443"
"Tobacco800";"pqw02f00-page07_6";"NextPage";"Maurice S. Meyer, Esquire January 13* 1975 Page Six or any brands. In this connection, we refer you to the in-troductory paragraph of the Order which in our view makes It clear that respondents are ordered tö include the warning Statement in the advertisement of their brands of cigarettes. An aisle marker which merely indicates where all brands of cigarettes mäy be purchased is’not an advertisement of any respondent's particular brands.         As to vending machines, the questions which we have to discuss are somewhat more complex. You may have noted that ""vending machines"" are not specifically referred to in the Order and that the Order deals with ""advertising"" and not with distribution. The suggested theory that those Cigarette manufacturers who through POP, which is the. agent for the vending machine maker, contract with the latter for an advertisement on a portion of the top panel of a machine, there-by exercise ""control"" over the operator of that machine we believe is not sustainable. Nor does the fact that a re-spondent pays modest sums to a machine operator for the stock-ing in some but not all of the columns of the machine consti-tute ""control.""         The further Suggestion that Paragraph G of the Order was intended to require an individual respondent, after July 14, 1972, to go out into the field and in some fashion get a warning Statement placed on hundreds of thousands of vending machines already In place cannot be remotely accepted.         There may be some mechanism by which the Commission, other than under this Order, could arrange that in the future on newly manufactured machines there be a comparable warning Statement. But this would have to be recognized as wholly apart from any concept that these respondents on and after July 14, 1972, were obligated in any way to deal with vending machine advertising display. panels other than under Section E of the Order. In this area of vending machines, we would appreciate any specific suggestions which you can develop.         As to billboards, an examination of Commission files on the negotiation of the Consent Order will demonstrate that the specifics in Paragraph D were developed in the light of the complexities of that mode of outdoor advertising involv-ing billboard sizes, different forms, distances from highways, and the like.

Meyer, Esquire January 13* 1975 Page Seven         We are prepared to discuss and to recoramend any rea-sonable suggestions you may have to offer that do not depart from the basics of Paragraph D or practically seek to curtail that mode of advertising. Here also there must be adequate recognition of -the fact that any type of change is not to be accomplished overnight but adequate lead times must be provided.         You will appreciate that these basic questions cover virtually all of the compliance issues that overall affect each of the six respondents. We believe it essential that consideration of vihat is to be done with respect to them for the future is Cardinal.         As to the particular advertisements in which the Staff believes it could recommend that there has been a willful Violation of the Order by particular respondents, to the injury of the public and as to which the Commission had previously indicated its objections, we believe that these can be discussed and evaluated once we have a clear understanding as to what changes are to be made for the future, the necessicy for agreed upon acetates, and an agreement that the production materials sent to media are to be the controlling poir.t in measuring compliance.         When we meet on Wednesday, we can also develop with you a schedule for the Submission of the requested forms cf column stocking contracts and of offers for distribution payments for cisplay of cigarettes. We regard these as cc~-pletely irrelevant, but would not be unwilling as part of settlement discussions to submit them.

California School I-MAG’s duties are to provide documentation and assemble racing footage for the use in two (2) instructional videos (6-8 minutes each), racing footage for playback during a bus trip designated by Philip Morris (25 minutes of footage) and a Compilation video of racing and evening events to be shown on the awards night for the California School. Upon arrival on-site on November 5, 1999, I-MAG will meet with individuals designated by Philip Morris and decide on a storyboard for the correct sequence of the taping. On November 6, 1999, a Sony miniature camera will be installed by I-MAG onto the exterior of the Van Demon racer designated by Philip Morris. This camera will allow the capture of footage for an instructional video. I-MAG will ensure that wind Vibration is kept to a minimum. The camera will view ahead of the racer and tilt down to capture the interior for gages and shifting of gears. Video taping will continue until the shoot list is completed. On the 2 seat model sedan, I-MAG’s camera operator will ride along holding the camera. Video taping will continue until the shoot list is completed. Auto narration will not be recorded on either of the instructional videos. Once all the footage is on tape, I-MAG will download the footage to a non-linear editing system provided by I-MAG. This system contains: • Apple Mac G3 Computer •   9 Gigabytes of storage capabilities •   TARGA Video Card •   Edit Controller •   Color Monitor •   Beta SP record • Beta SP playback • VHS record/playback Deck •   14” colormonitor This non-linear system will be driven by Scitex Statusphere/Microsphere Software provided by I-MAG. I-MAG will digitize the video data and perform DVE effects, dissolves and output to tape for playback. Both Beta SP cameras with 16x zoom lenses will photograph approximately 25 minutes of stock footage of race track for the purpose of introducing the MARLBORO Racing concept. Shots of crews, pit areas, Staging and surrounding will be edited by I-MAG and dumped to VHS tape by I-MAG for viewing by individuals designated by Philip Morris upon such individuals’ arrival from the airport to the hotel. I-MAG will design/storyboard, add graphics when needed, add audio, and music when desired by Philip Morris or I-MAG to enhance the video presentation."

Immunoprecipation of S-methionine labeled proteins from chicken embryo flbroblasts with anti-idiotypic antibody to yes protein (imm8, imm9) and with pre-immune sera (pre8, prefl). A protein of relative molecular mass 65 kD (arrow) was reproducibly precipitated from the labeled cells.    Fig. 2. Immune blot analysis of total lysates of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) with anti-idiotypic antibody raised against yes protein.    Total lysate of CEF from different passages (to ensure lack of contamination from non-fibroblastic cells) was fractionated on SDS-gel, lanes 3-5. The first lane shows the immunopre-cipitate of CEF lysate with preimmune serum and the second lane with immune serum. The blot was probed with anti-idiotypic IgG and iodinated protein A. Positive results in immune blot analysis encouraged screening of a Purkinje «ell-enriched cDNA library with anti-idiotypic ntibody.    Fig. 3. Northern blot analysis of mRNA for anti-idiotypic clone and for yes gene. Poly (A)+ RNA was isolated from two-week-old chicks and 5 ug of the RNA was fractionated on agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. T, telencephalon; C, cerebellum; S, spieen; I, in-testine; M, muscle; H, heart; L, liver; K, kidney. cDNA encoded by anti-idiotypic clone (upper panel) and chicken yes cDNA (lower panel) were used as probes. Probes were labeled by random priming using radioactive dCTP.    Fig. 4. Sequence of expression clone isolated from Purkinje cell-enriched library with anti-idiotypic antibody. The EcoRI-EcoRI insert of 1001 bp encodes an open reading frame that is in frame with sequence of beta-galactosidase protein of the phage. The coding sequence shows no significant similarity at either the nucleic acid or protein levels to any known sequence in Gene Bank.    Fig. 6. Analysis of 65 kD protein and p62c*^cfi immunoprecipitated from glycerol gradient (10-30%) fractions of total lysate of chicken embryo fibroblasts labeled with radioactive leu-cine. Fractions were divided in half and precipitated with anti-idiotypic antibody (upper panel) or with anti-yes IgG (lower panel). The c-yes protein was visualized by autophospho-rylation in immune complex kinase assay. Both proteins comigrated in heavy fractions of the gradient.    Fig. 6. Three proteins associated with p60c""5rc in A431 cells treated with calcium ionophore. control A431 cells precipitated with anti-sre monoclonal antibody. After addition of calci-^^im ionophore (B, 10 minutes; C, 30 minutes; D, 1 hr; E, 6 hr) cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and immune complex kinase assay was performed on src immunoprecipitates. Solid arrows indicate proteins that are apparently associated with src kinase and are phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo on tyrosine residues."

Please note that this page limit includes FIGURES and REFERENCES. BACKGROUND     The first identification of transforming genes came from studies of RNA tumor viruses (1,2). These viral genes, called oncogenes (v-onc), were later shown to be altered versions of normal cellular genes, called proto-oncogenes (c-onc) (1,6). The common feature of all oncogenes is their ability to induce transformation of normal cells. In contrast, no common functional denominator has been found for the proto-oncogenes identified to date, but it is as-sumed that these genes control aspects of cellular growth and differentiation. Some proto-oncogenes code for growth factors, growth factor receptors that encode kinases, or GTP-binding proteins (7). Others code for plasma membrane associated or cytoplasmic kinases, and proteins localized in the nucleus (29). Our research is focused on those proto-oncogenes which encode non-receptor type protein-tyrosine kinases. The physiological functions of these proteins are not known.     Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) was the first virus shown to induce solid tumors in animals (22), and cell transformation by RSV is one of the most well-studied systems of tumorigenesis (11). The transforming gene product of RSV, p60 ""         , is a 60 kD membrane-associated phosphoprotein that possesses intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity (2,11,14)^ The biochemical properties of its cellular homologue, p60 ""   , are similar to those of p60 "" , ex- cept that as a result of mutations, the tyrosine kinase activity of the viral protein is elevated at least ten-fold in comparison to the cellular enzyme (8).     The transforming properties of Yamaguchi 73 (Y73) and Esh avian sarcoma viruses are directed by cell-derived yes sequences (24,36). These viruses were independently isolated from spontaneous tumors in chickens (9,36). Both are replication defective, induce sarcomas in vivo, and transform chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) in vitro (5). The v-yes transforming gene of Y73 virus also encodes a phosphoprotein with tyrosine-specific kinase activity. The amino acid sequence of v-yes shows a high degree of homology with p60v""Ärc (12). The greatest extent of sequence similarity exists in the carboxy-terminal domains. The c-yes sequence differs from its viral homologue by 4 amino acid substitutions and in its carboxy-terminal peptides (28). As in the case of sre, the kinase activity of v-yes protein is elevated compared to that of p62c'yes (26).                             C“t/ßÄ     Comparison of the p62 y and p60 sequences to a protein data bank reveals 4 blocks of amino acid sequence similarity to other members of the non-receptor dass of protein-tyrosine kinases (36). These blocks are termed A, B, C, and kinase domain, Two of these blocks, one of approximately 50 amino acids (block B), and the other of approximately 10 residues (block C), are found in all non-receptor tyrosine kinases and were previously termed the ”SH2” domain (for sre homology 2, SH1 being the kinase domain) (36,39). The third block of homology, termed A or ”SH3”, is present in all cellular non-receptor tyrosine kinases except c-fps. Recently other gene products have been shown to contain SH3 and/or SH2 domains. These include the erk oncogene (34), phospholipases (43), GTPase Activator Protein (55), and spectrins (32). The presence of strongly conserved SH2 and SH3 motifs in diverse proteins implicated in signal transduction suggests an important function for these domains. We propose an anti-idiotypic approach for isolating the proteins that interact with the SH3 and SH2 domains of p62C""^ and p60c_src.     Expression of p62°""yCÄ is relatively high in the brain, retina, liver, kidney, and lung of birds and mammals. In the brain, elevated levels of p62c""^c are found in cerebellum, specifically in its Purkinje cells (26,27,29,30). In this proposal, we describe Isolation of a pro-"
"Tobacco800";"pym00d00-page14_5";"NextPage";"3b Sudol, Marius 129-68-8626 tein that interacts with the yes kinase. The molecular clone encoding this protein was isolat-ed from a cDNA expression library constructed from an enriched preparation of Purkinje cells,     To study the functions of tyrosine kinases it is important to identify their Substrates. Many cellular proteins have been identified that are phosphorylated on tyrosine by activated forms of the kinases in transformed cells. A number of laboratories are trying to purify these proteins using conventional biochemical and molecular biology techniques, and to show a causal relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins and cell transforma-tion. Our aim is to identify the Substrates of proto-oncogenes. We propose to isolate Substrates of the cellular src kinase from A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells treated with calcium ionophore. We expect that characterizing the Substrate proteins for the c-src kinase will provide clues to the function of this proto-oncogene. SIGNIFICANCE     Several experimental approaches indicate that receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases form complexes with cellular proteins, In the case of the receptors a number of molecules in-teracting with them have been identified and some of these molecules have been implicated in receptor-mediated signal transduction processes (32). Our research is aimed at dissecting the cellular and molecular processes in which two representative non-receptor tyrosine kinases, namely yes and src, are involved. The immediate goals of this research are the Identification of molecules that associate with and are phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases, and the charac-terization of processes by which these molecules communicate. We anticipate that our results will have broad implications for understanding the processes that control cellular growth and differentiation, Moreover, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of proto-oncogene action could also provide the basis for an understanding of how transforming genes subvert normal growth control, and could point towards potential therapies for controlling malignant diseases in humans. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN & METHODS     a. Anti-idiotypic approach     We have shown that polyomavirus middle-T antigen can associate with and be phosphorylated by the c-yes kinase (13). Two other tyrosine kinases, src and /yn, are known to bind to middle-T protein as well (3,4,15). In the case of src and yes, this association changes the specific activity of these enzymes in autophosphorylation assays and in the phosphorylation of an exogenous ""substrate” protein, enolase. In addition to the implications for the mechanism of transformation by polyomavirus, these findings set the stage for studying cellular proteins that might interact with tyrosine kinases in a manner similar to that shown for the viral middle-T protein. We decided to use an anti-idiotypic approach to search for cellular proteins that interact with and possibly modulate the yes and src kinases. This approach is based on the observation that antibody directed to antigen may itself engender an immune response (10,18). The resulting anti-idiotypic antibody mimics the original antigen and there-fore can bind with high affmity molecules that interact with the antigen,     It has been proposed that the amino terminal portions of non-receptor type tyrosine kinases have a regulatory role because mutations in these regions can influence the enzymatic activity of these proteins (21,23). In addition, these mutations produce host-range mutant phenotypes which could be explained only by assuming the interaction of the amino terminal domains of tyrosine kinases with unknown cellular proteins (21). To test this hypothesis we generated antibodies against a polyclonal antibody directed to the amino terminal region of the yes protein (containing the entire SH3 domain and the yes-specific region at the amino-"
"Tobacco800";"pym00d00-page14_6";"NextPage";"3c  Sudol, Marius 129-68-8626 terminal region) (26). The anti-idiotypic antibody was obtained in rabbits and tested in im-munoprecipitation assays. It precipitated and recognized on immune blots a 65 kD protein (Fig. 1 & 2) with the following characteristics: the protein was not active as a kinase, it was not phosphorylated on tyrosine, it was expressed in the brain and in primary and tertiary CEFs, and it comigrated with p62c""ycs in heavy fractions on glycerol gradients (Fig. 5). This suggests to us that the two proteins form a complex.     Using the anti-idiotypic antibody and a cDNA expression library constructed of mRNA from the molecular layer of the cerebellum (which contains Purkinje cells), we have isolated one positive clone whose fusion protein competed away the 65 kD protein in precipitation assays. The partial coding sequence of the clone (which we call clone 11) shows no significant similarity at either the nucleic acid or protein levels to any known sequence in the Gene Bank (Fig. 4). The new gene encodes a 4.2 kb mRNA and is expressed in various tissues including the brain, kidney, liver, and spieen (Fig. 3 & 4).     We will characterize the complete cDNA sequence encoding the 65 kD protein. We have isolated 5 cDNA clones from a chicken brain cDNA library using the clone 11 cDNA as probe. Their sizes are 2.4, 2.3, 2.3, 1.0, and 1.2 kb. Analysis of these clones at the level of primary sequence is in progress.     To show direct interaction between p62C~yes and the 65 kD protein we will generate antibodies against the 65 kD protein by expressing its cDNA in bacteria. We will select those fragments of the cDNA which do not encode parts of the protein involved in the apparent interaction with the yes kinase, that is, outside of the sequence contained in clone 11. An expression vector based on the trpE operon will be used to produce large quantities of these an-tigens in bacteria (35), We will test the interaction of the 65 kD protein with the viral- yes gene product and with other proto-oncogene and oncogene proteins, including src, cr/c, and fps. Once direct physical interaction is documented and its effect on the kinase activity of yes protein is shown, we will construct various deletion mutants of c-j/es and of the 65 kD protein in order to map accurately the domains involved in the interaction between these proteins.     Encouraged by the preliminary results with anti-idiotypic antibodies for p62e”^CÄ, we are planning to extend this approach to other domains of yes protein and to the viral and cellular-src protein. Using available polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, we will generate anti-idiotypic antibodies to other domains of p62c""^c* and to p60c-src, specifically to the SH2 domain and to the extreme amino terminal domain involved in the interaction with mem-brane receptors. Polyclonal antibodies against the SH3 and SH2 domains of human yes (35), cominercially available antibody against the extreme amino terminal domain of src (Mab 2-17 from NCI), and monoclonal antibody GDll against the SH3 domain of src (20) will be used.     A number of complications are anticipated with the above approach. Antibodies raised against monoclonal antibodies do not necessarily produce anti-idiotypic reagents (16). The epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies selected by us do not have to represent domains involved in protein-protein interactions or could recognize partially denatured epitopes. To increase our chances of raising anti-idiotypic antibodies we will also use polyclonal antibodies. The Fab fragments, which contain antigen-recognition domains, will be isolated from the affinity purified polyclonal IgGs and used as antigens.     Stringent criteria will be used to climinate false positives, i.e., proteins precipitated by the immune serum as a result of raising antibodies to antigens contaminating the IgG or Fab fragment preparations. These criteria will include; the formation of a complex with the original antigen, the recognition of the secondary antigen, the Isolation of clones which code for"
"Tobacco800";"pym00d00-page14_7";"NextPage";"3d Sudol, Marius 129-68-8626 discrete mRNA and whose fusion proteins prevent the formation of a protein-onc complex, Special attention will be given to proteins which are phosphorylated on tyrosine.     b. Potential Substrates of the Cellular-src Kinase     We propose to isolate Substrates of the src proto-oncogene kinase. It is likely that these Substrates are different from those of the v-src protein, the activated tyrosine kinase. The choice of this experimental model came from studies on the differentitation of keratinocytes. We observed that the endogenous p60°""src in A431 cells treated with micromolar concentra-tions of calcium ionophore in the presence of extracellular calcium shows association with 3 cellular proteins of molecular masses 120, 67, and 37 kD (Fig. 6). These proteins coprecipitat-ed with p60c_5rc in detergent containing buffers and were phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo on tyrosine. The pattern of their association with p60c"" C was not dependent on the antibody used as other monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies showed similar results. The src-associated proteins are not related to each other or to p60 "" as determined by one dimensional peptide mapping. This phenomenon was not observed for p62c ~^CS.     Using Standard methods of protein chemistry, we will purify the 3 proteins associated with p60 ""5rc. Affinity chromatography with src monoclonal antibody GD11 (20) coupled to CNBr activated Sepharose will be used. Large quantities of A431 cells will be grown in roller bottles. FPLC (which is available in the lab) will be employed to optimize the conditions of purification. Purified proteins will be subjected to partial protein microsequencing in order to obtain Information for the synthesis of oligonucleotide probes, Isolation and characterization of cDNAs for the polypeptides will be performed using basic methods of molecular cloning.     We will characterize these proteins using Standard biochemical technlques. The basic ap-proach will be to generate antibodies to the proteins predicted from DNA sequence analysis of molecular clones. Antigens will be either synthetic peptides or proteins expressed in bacteria from cDNA clones. For this purpose, we will take advantage of the University’s biochemistry service laboratory for synthesizing peptides and the animal facilities for keeping rabbits. The antibodies will be used to identify and characterize these proteins in control A431 cells and in cells treated with calcium ionophore. Many different biochemical properties of these proteins will be investigated, includjng phosphorylation, subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and interaction with p60 ""    .  To determine the binding regions, we will generate various deletion mutants in the molecular clones expressed in bacteria and we will study the formation of complexes in vitro. Available mutants of p60 "" should be helpful if we show that the chicken src protein can associate with these proteins as the human src protein does. By studying these 3 proteins we may eventually be able to reconstruct the initial molecular events involved in the activation of p60 in normal cells.     Some complications are anticipated. The studied proteins may not be phosphorylated by p60c'5rc but by other cellular kinases activated by the treatment of A431 cells with calcium ionophore. Therefore the pathway that we think is specific for src may be more complicated. Minute quantities of purified proteins (nanograms) may present difficulties in obtaining protein sequence data, especially if their amino termini are blocked and further manipuiations are required to generate internal peptides. We are testing now whether overexpression of the c-src protein in A431 cells can increase the relative concentration of proteins within the complex. LITERATURE CITED     1. Bishop, M.

Schüller:       You may already be aware that the US Department of Health and Human Services has requested information from tobacco manufacturers relating to the ingredients commonly added to commer-cially manufactüred cigarettes. This request was 'made as first step by HHS in compliance with Section 403 of Public Law 95-626 which re.quires that the Secretary of this Department ""shall conduct, or arrange the conduct of, a study or studies of,          (1) the relative health risks associated v;ith smoking cigarettes of varying levels of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide; and (2) the health risks associated with smoking cigarettes containing any substances commonly added to commercially manufactured cigarettes."" Various tobacco Companies have responded to these requests giving general information and Information not considered to be proprietary in nature. HHS has responded to these submissions asking for more detail.       In accordance with the confidentiality agreement between Lorillard and Givaudan dated August 1979, Section D, Page 5, I am requesting from Givaudan a letter authorizing Lorillard to disclose the contents of the flavor ingredient lists supplied by Givaudan as part of a composite scrambled list of all flavor ingredients used. by Lorillard if a government agency formally demands such disclosure. In the event that Lorillard is required by the government to disclose the flavor ingredients used, we intend to.supply an alphabetical listing of all ingredients' thus making it impossible to determine the composition of any single compounded flavor represented therein. Furthermore, unless specifically required to do so, we do not-intend to identify the sources of these ingredients.

Hoyt Tobacco Industry Research Committee 5U.00 Empire State Building New York 1, N.Y. Dear Tom;          I am retuming the material from Dr. Flynn. This looks like one of the many attempts to prove an infectious agent for cancer. There is no evidence in favor of Dr. Flynn’s hypothesis, and much trouble to be expected-from any encouragement of it, or from becoming entangled with it. My advice would be to stay clear of it with great enthusiasm in doing so.                                                                      Yours as ever, CCL:gc Encl."

Thank you. I had hoped to fly back from Bristol to New York to catch at least part of the meeting. In the event, the local Situation proved to be overwhelming; my mother of ninety three needed a lot of help. I am sorry to have let you down but it was unavoidable. Now, back in Winnipeg I take up the loose strings. I have completed the form for the Mexico meeting. With luck we will stay on for a few extra days but the room rates at the Ritz are too Ritzy for my post retirement budget. We shall look eisewhere. Joyce send warm greetings to you and to Gail and we look forward with pleasure to seeing you in February. Sincerely"

Loews Corporation, ihe Council for Tobacco Research - U.S. A., Inc. And the Tobacco Institute.        By subpoenas dated February 19,1998 to reprcsentadves of the above-named eniides, the Committee on Commerce demanded the ptoducrion to Congress of “*[a]ll documents which are idendfred in the sealed recommendations to Judge FitzpatricL dated February 10,1998 in $m PfMimttOT and Blae.Cr^g ^ ?lae Mil rf Minnesota v§, Philip Momsipcofporaied et al. for which Special Master Mark W.

Judge Fittpatrick’s order was issued by electronic filing on Saturday, March 7, at approxünately 8:04 a.m. It called for the ptoducrion of some 30,000 privileged documents ‘*within forty-eight (48) hours from the daie and xjpne of filing of this Order7 (i£., no later than Monday, March 9, at 8:04 a.m.).

The next day - Sunday, March 8 - ihe Minnesota Court of Appeals issued iis own stay of ihe mal coun’s order. On Monday, March 9, ihe tobacco Companies, CTR and TX filed with Minnesota Court of Appeals their petition for a wnt of prohtbition or, in ihe alternative, a writ of mandamus.        The appellate siay of Judge Fiizpairick’s March 7,1998 Order delaying the immediaie public release of some 30,üöü privikged documems was absoluteiy essential in order to preserve an oppommity for meaamgfui appellate review. The stay has ensured that the Minnesota appellate courts will have a Chance to review the trial court’s rulings before the tobacco Companies, CTR and TI suffer irreparable barm ffora iraproper disclosures of attorney-dient confidences and trial preparation materials. Absent a stay, ihe conßdenüalicy of thousands of such auomey-client communicadons and trial preparation materials would have been lost already, effectively “mooting” any appeal before it could be heard.        Nor can rhere be any quesüon that serious appellate rights are at stäke here. The appellate petition filed by the tobacco Companies, CTR and TT in Minnesota calls into question the faimess and ieliability of vinually eveiy aspect of ihe privilege proceedings conducted by the mal court As sei fonh in petitioners’ briefs, which are attached heieto for the Commiuee’s conveitieace:        - The trial coun’s March 7 order was uqj based on a documeni-by-document review or analysis of the docuraents ordered to be disclased. To the comraiy, the overwhelming raajoriiy of these documems - some 98% -- have neveiLbeeru^virwed by either the trial court or the Special Master. Beyond this. the trial coun and Special Master conceded that. of the 2% that were reviewed, a number in fact were found to be privüeged but were nonetheless ordered to be produced as a casualty of the indiscriminate category-by-category privilege review process used in this case.        - Such Wholesale abrogation of the attomey-client privilege and anomey worlc product doctrine - by failing to review the bulk of the documems and using a procedure that guarantees the release of large numbets of genuinely privüeged Communications -violates Minnesota law. In dircenng the disclosute of tens of thousands of privüeged documems sigfo unseen. the trial coun denied defendants the core anomey work product protection essential to faimess in our adversarial system. If these documems hemme public wiihout a proper document-by-documem screening for privilege, the State of Minnesota will be given a road map to defense counsel’s strategies and opinions infoe midtotan ^irgomg ml        - The trial coun’ s March 7 order denies due process under both the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. The trial coun disregarded petitioners’ due process right with respect io some 98% of the documems ai issue by ordering iheir release without ieviewing them and wiihout giving petitioners an oppommity to be heard. For a court to strip away a long-serded privilege tetroactively - afier parties have relied on its pmiections and wiihout any judicial analysis of the privüeged Communications - violates any lest or notion of due process.         - The mal court erred because it misupplied the crirae-fraud exception. to the attorney-dient privilege. In particular, the coun eliminated the long-seuled legal 2   oo   OJ   ON   to   -pa.   o   CO   CM"

Such a rule destroys the entire cnncem of a pri'^ge, because eveiy time a client accused of a crime or fraud had a discussion with his aooraey on a subject “relaring” io that alleged crime or fraud the piivilege would be forfeited.                In short, the petition is not based upon minor, techmcal Claims of error thar would change the resulc below only with respect to a handful of nrivüeged materials.

JRI/HEJ 18 February 1986 Dr D Stone Council for Tabacco Research - U.S.A. Inc. 900 Third Avenue New York NY 10022 U.S.A. Dear Dr Stone Re:   Grant  Application  // 1955 - Edward Calabrese, Ph.D. Thank you for sending me the above application and enclosures. I apologise for the short delay, but it has taken me some time to go through it thöroughly. I have organised my comments into the areas which I        think  are pertinent to any grant application. I hope that these will help you         reach  a decision, (i) Aims of the project The applicant seeks to confirm and extend the findings published by us in 1984 that there is a possible inherited and metabolic susceptibility to lung cancer in smokers. They do not propose to deviate signifieantly from our own study design with the exception of selection of different types of Controls and a broader data analysis. (ii) Work which led up to the project A decade of research effort almost exclusively in our own        laboratories has  led to a greater understanding of the genetics of human drug oxidation processes. At least three independent allelomorphic genes have been described, those regulating debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation and carbocisteine S-oxidation - the applicant refers only to the former of these. Over the years, Tt has been shown that many oxidative pathways are influenced to a greater or lesser degree by the gene which regulates debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation, In addition, there are many pharmaco-kinetic, therapeutic and toxicological sequelae of the polymorphism. Our own biochemical epidemiological studies in lung cancer patients and Controls form the basis of Calabrese’s application. The lack of perception of the relevant litera-ture to date shown by the applicant in my view detracted considerably from his case. There are several miscitations of the literature and in addition Dr Calabrese has found it necessary to quote directly from our-papers rather than paraphrasing them. Most: importantly, none of the work which has led up to the proposed project was carried out by Dr Calabrese and his collaborators."
"Tobacco800";"rqv98d00-page02_2";"NextPage";"2 18 February 1986 Dr D Stone (üi) Methode to be used I have no real feelings regarding the-selection and investigation methods which are described for patients, relatives and Controls. It would not be ethical in most U.K. centres to offer financial inducements, This is referred to as a ""stipend"" in the consent document, The applicant seeks to measure debrisoquine and 4-hydroxy-debrisoquine in up to 3000 urine specimens and has as yet not developed locally any expertise in this assay. I find this a little disturbing since they also plan to deviate from the established electron-capture assay which has been widely employed in the U.K0 and utilise a flame-ionisation detection method. In addition, samples of authentic debrisoquine, 4-hydroxy-debriscquine and the internal Standard are not widely available and I am presently unaware of any approach to obtain them. It is possible that the applicant intends to carry out some Chemical synthesis de novo. In any case, I find it flippant that the possib-ility of having a working assay, upon which the project would depend completely, has not yet been better explored by the applicant, The Statistical methodology appears adequate. However, better epidemiologic advice could be taken so that the maximum value could be obtained from such a study, for example lifestyle and dietary questionnaire and family history of disease, (iv) Funding and resources sought I found it hard to interpret some of the financial requests. If I am not mistaken, the applicant seeks funding for the salaries of 19 workers including himself, running costs and capital expenditure to the sum total of approximately $3„2 million over three years. To put this into proper perspective, the study which Dr Calabrese seeks to confirm was carried out by a clinical PhD Student who also did all the laboratory analysis. I would estimate that no more than $70,000 were spent on itD Conclusion The application is both naive and repetitive, It does not serve to advance our knowledge of cancer cause. It makes no intellectual steps above and beyond our own published work on the subject, I can only conclude that in some way Dr Calabrese's unit is under threat and that this application is the best he can produce to underpin its funding. Finally, you should know that the NIH have commissioned a study of debrisoquine hydroxylation in cancer and control patients which began in 1985 and will, amongst other things, answer all the questions posed in this application.

Stuhl subject: Nitrogen containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons           (N-PAH) in tobacco smoke              *            General           Cigarette smoke contains a low quantity of different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH, e.g. benzopyrene) which are alleged to possess carcinogenic properties. Nitrogen containing N-PAH's are of similar Chemical structure, i.e. have one or several carbon atoms substituted by nitrogen. This dass of compounds is now being studied by various researchers.           In early 1980 two Japanese researchers (Yoshida and Matsumoto) showed two (X -carbolines (two N-PAH compounds) to be mutagenic in the Ames test. Similar properties were attributed to l -carbolines by Sugimura (1980).                                         9            VdC Activities            Because of these publications the VdC asked Dr. Neurath in spring 1980 to analyze the harmane and norharmane (twoß -carbolines) content in the main- and sidestream smoke of various tobaccos, and subsequently to analyze - and -carbolines in main- and sidestream smoke of several tobaccos. In addition Dr. Neurath will be asked to investigate whether an increased nicotine level will support theß -carboline formation. (approved 10/2/80).            Coincidentally, the VdC has been approached by Prof. Grimmer for granting him money to conduct a study on N-PAH formation and analysis in the smoke of several German cigarettes.            The matter has been discussed by the TFA, resulting in the formation of a task force which will work out a proposal on how to proceed. (12/17/80). The task force met 1/8/1981 in Vienna to discuss two projects:                                                                                     - 2 -   tn   o   to   O'   e   ui   o                   soc3 colosnc - -ei.eF’i-'Oisie iqseh ssv-i tei.ex eeessos c&ble reynolqstobacco colcgne"
"Tobacco800";"rxm78d00-page02_2";"NextPage";"FsUfS?  a) Dr. Neurath: The influence of the nicotine content on the N-PAH concentra-tion in tobacco smoke. For that purpose plain cigarettes (based on E76 blend) with varying amounts of nicotine (added via nicotine impregnated HTL) will      be used. Condensate of 3000 - 5000 cigarettes will be collected and ana-lyzed. The N-PAH fraction will be separated via HPLC and the components will be identified by means of GC/MS.      In addition, tobacco and smoke will be analyzed by common routine methods (e.g. ash content, total nitrogen content).      The use of radioactively labelled nicotine as,.alternative was discussed -no decision.  b) Prof. Grimmer: Determination and importance of nitrogenous tobacco ingredients which can be defined as N-PAH precursors.      A list of nitrogenous components of tobacco was prepared and the proposal made to add these compounds (e.g. amino acids, nitrates, protein, amines) to the tobacco blend as impregnated HTL foil and analyse for their role in the formation of N-PAH.  The results of this first task force meeting were discussed in the Tabakforschungs-ausschuB (TFA) of the Verband on January 15, 1981.  To discuss further details a second task force meeting will be held in Vienna on February 12, 1981. RJR will be represented by 0. Stuhl.  The following questions will be discussed:  - whether to start the research project a) with unlabelled nicotine at first and then later repeat it with labelled nicotine.  - where is ^N-labelled nicotine avialable (PM?, Austria?),  - who will produce the HTL and the complete cigarettes,  - what the' implications were of using otherwise labelled nicotine.  - how other potential precursors could be labelled. 0.

We would be happy to have someone from his laboratory spend a day or so with us, This should be timed when Mr. Agustin Lopez is here as he is the technician most familiar with the Instrument.       As to the animal holders, we see no difference in uptake of smoke, however, it depends on whether or not Dr. Wilson will be worried about nlcotine on the für and continued exposure through the residue on the für. The advantage of the cones is that ten mice can be exposed per side instead of six mice with the neck holders.       The CoHb has been done only on 2A1 cigarettes at this time. We have scheduled the 2.R1 for the first of the year. Dr. Henry can discuss our finding with Dr. Wi 1son.       The dosimetry papers are at 0RNL for thelr final revision. We should be able to get preprlnts to Dr. Wilson by the end of January.       We will be happy to help Dr. Wilson in any way. We will be most anxious to see what he finds out about genetic aspects of nicotine behavlor.       Best wishes for Christmas and the New Year. S i neerely,  Carrie E.

"Tobacco800";"sik79d00";"FirstPage";"February 19, 1980                               Brand Management Recommendation To:   Mr. N. W. Glover Res SALEM FF/Lts. Improved Packaging This recommends the national expanslon of SALEM Full Flavor and Lights improved pack/ carton designs currently in test market.  • Full Flavor - Target smokers currently perceive SALEM Full Flavor as a brand smoked more by middle-aged men and women who hold somewhat more traditional values. This smoker image is not ideal as target smokers want a brand which is smoked by rela-' tively young (age 35) adult males (and females) with Contemporary lifestyles. Kool Full Flavor is superior on these dimensions.     With the objective of improving SALEM Full Flavor's image, the brand introduced new packaging into test market last November. Judgementally, the refinements provide for a more updated and masculine look to the package as well as help improve shelf visibility. We believe the new packaging, in conjunction with the new ""High Country"" advertising, will achieve the desired smoker image improvements.  • Lights - The revised packaging is believed to provide a more modern/contemporary image for the brand, consistent with the wants of target smokers. In addition, it maintains an esthetic consistency between the 85*s and 100's styles, as opposed to current packaging which differs slightly in graphic design for the brand name/style.     The graphic refinements incorporated in the 85's package also provide a slightly more masculine appearance (than before) to this package. This is of particular importance given the prime prospect for the 85's style which reflects a more balanced male/female profile than the female skew that existed in earlier years. Recommendation - National expansion of SALEM Full Flavor and Lights improved packaging. Shipments to market to begin 5/12 with 80%+ distribution at retail achieved by 7/1. Purchasing will coordinate the phasing out of the current package materials at a maxi-mum cost of $10M to total SALEM.                                                             —  • To date, MRD has not received any consumer complaint letters on Full Flavor packaging, and only two on Lights.

GC/mass spectral Identification of the flavor components produced in fractions #4-#16 was reported earlier (Hsieh, File Note, March 28, 1980). No good Identification was made on fractions H1-Ü3 due to their high volatility which caused partial sample loss before GG/MS analysis. Since the first b fraotions gave particularly favorable organoleptic evaluation as cigarette additives (Cravotta, Memo, March 19, 1980), they were prepared in larger amounts and subjected to capillary GC/MS analysis under improved sample handling and GC conditions. ComptJnenls identified using this approach are reported below. Experimental proceduros are described in the Appendix. Figure 1 shows the preparative gas chromatogram, Please note that fraction #4 was further resolved into subfractions #4-1 and #4-2. Table I lists in the order of increasing GC retention time the flavor components identified by capillary GC/MS. Components tentatively identified are indicated by an asterisk (*). For fractions #4-#6, newly identified components (not reported previously) are labeled by an ampersand (6). Relative abundante of the identified components within each fraction is shown by peak sizes: +, small; ++, medium; and +++, large.                                                      T. C.

J'm writing to.confirm the agreement we reached regardbig Marlboro Racing Exparienee and California SportService. it is my underwanding that we are all in agreementthar for the next round of die Marlboro Racing Experience which is September 21* rhrough October 6*, Marlboro willcontinue to purchase all food and beverage items directly from California SportService. Bpginning with the Marlboro Racing Experience scheduled to suri on November 6* and continue on various days through December 15* Marlboro will be able to conduct their own food and beverage Service without the invoivement of California SportService. ln consideration of this privifege Marlboro agrees to pay California SportService a self<atering fee of $2,500 per day for each event food servjce day. Set up and teardown days will not require any selfcataring fee. Marlboro will be invoiced by California SportService on a monthly basis for all event day self-catering fees.         This agreement will remain in effect for the balance of 2000 and all scheduled Marlboro Racing Experience event food Service days in 2001. The setteaxering fee will be reviewed and potentiaily modified by mutual Agreement for 2002 and beyond. A formal agreement will be provided by our legal department in the near future as this is intended only to confinm our verbal agreement.         if chis document accurately reflects your underscanding please indicate by signing below and retuming a copy to my attention orsending a confirming letter.

Molloy                 RE:   1981  Corporate  Magazines       The attached list represents corporate magazine commitments for 1981 beyond those that are normally recommended for our brands (i.e., Time, Sports Illustrated, TV Guide, etc.). They -■ qualify as corporate properties because of advantageous positions, special campaigns, exclusive of other tobaccos, and other reasons that make them important to us.           .       The number of issues assigned to each brand is negotiable when all brand media plans for 1981 have been presented and evaluated.                             > ■  .

Lantdry SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT director of MARKETING                                                             January   4,    19  82       Dear Dinny:       This letter is to confirm the discussions we have had on the idea of a $1 million bonus to any horse winning all three of the Autumn Triple Crown races. Those three races would comprise the $200,000 Woodward on September 4, the $400,000 Marlboro Cup on September 18 (the full $400,000 purse in 1982 will be put up by Philip Morris U.S.A.), and the $500,000 Jockey Club Gold Cup on October 9.       Our Insurance Department received a quote of a $100,000 premium for the insurance on the $1 million bonus. I believe this is quite a bit less than the previous quote your people had received and I think it seems reasonable. Philip Morris U.S.A. would, as I have mentioned to you, pay 33-1/3% of the $100,000 total.       Although The Marlboro Cup is an invitational handi-cap, we would certainly guarantee that any winner of the Woodward would be invited to The Marlboro Cup so that there would be no chance anyone would be denied the opportunity to participate in all three races.       As discussed, I believe that the $1 million bonus idea would create extra interest and excitement around the Fall Triple Classics. I would think it would certainly encourage horsemen to aim for the three races and that it would enhance our chances of keeping the better horses in New York for the September-October period. I think it is also a more appealing plan than a single $1 million race which, in many ways, might demean the rest of the stakes program. 2049443564"

Subfractions from preparative gas chromatography were analyzed by fused silica capillarv GC/mass spectrometry. Experimental details are described in the Appendix. Figure I shous the preparative gas chromatogram. Table 1 lists the odor transition observed organoleptically at the GC exit port during the period each subfraction was being eluted, Table II lists in the order of increasing GC retention time the components identified by capillary GC/MS. Components tentatively identified are indicated by an asterisk (*), Relative abundance of the identified components wiebln each sub-fraction is indicated by peak sizes: +, small; ++, medium; and +++, large. Amadori compounds from various amino acids and glucose or fructose have been found by many food flavor investigators to be the flavor precursors in Maillard reaction. The fact that Amadori compounds are more polar and have higher molecular weights would probablv make them stay longer in the finished tobacco products than the volatile flavor molecules. Synthetic methods and Isolation procedures for Amadori compounds have been obtained through literature searches. Studies on the effect(s) of Amadori compounds on cigarettes to produce the desirable Maillard reaction aroma seem worth-while pursuing.                                          T. C.

Thirty grams of reaction ""A"" mixture were mixed thoroughly with 300 ml of methanol/water (70/30) and filtered with suction. The methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure. The sample was extracted successively with 400 ml each of diethyl ether, Chloroform, and toluene. The aqueous layer was concentrated about 5 fo)d for preparative gas chromatography. Preparative Gas Chromatography About 30 ul of the above sample was chromatographed on a 10 ft. x 4 mm I.D. glass column packed with 15% Carbovax 20M on 100/120 mesh AW/DMCS chromosorb W using an HP-7624 gas Chromatograph. The column temperature was programmed from 60°C to 23Q°C at 4°C/rain. and held at the upper limit. Helium was used as carrier gas at 50 ml/min. The subfractions were collected in 2 mm glass U-tubes cooled in an ethanol/dry ice bath. Twenty ul of methylene Chloride was introduced to wash the inner wall of the U-tube immediately after collection. The tubes were then sealed at the ends with parafilm and kept in a dry ice box until analyzed by capillary GC/MS. Fused Silica Capillary GC/MS Each of the subfractions collected in the ü-tubes was further chromatographed qn a 50m x 0.2 mm I.D. fused silica capillary column of SP-2100 in a Flnnigan 4023 GC/tlS/data system. With helium as a carrier gas at 1-3 ml/min. the column temperature was programmed from 40°C (held for 4 min.) to 200°C at a rate of 2-40C/inin. Electron impact mode of MS was carried out on all the samples while Chemical ionization mode on some samples to verify triolecular weight assignment.                                               606000772"

KORNEGAY  President May 13, 1975 Mr. Colin Stokes Chairman of the Board of Directors R. J. Reynolds Industries, Inc. 401 North Main Street Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27102 Dear Colin: The terms on which your and other Companies agreed to participate in the establishment and Operation of the Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory (T.I.T.L.) were set förth in the Institute letter of November 1, 1966, which was accepted by each participating Company. Based on recent discussions which I have had with each participating Company, it appears desirable, and acceptable to all participating Companies, to modify the terms for financing the operating of the T.I.T.L. The November 1, 1966 letter made the following Provision for defraying the expenses of the T.I.T.L.:            4. Each Company participating in the T.I.T.L. shall make an annual payment of Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00) for purposes of defraying the expenses of operating the laboratory. The balance- of the expense of establishing and operating the laboratory shall be allocated egually among the participating Companies whose respective annual sales of USA tax-paid cigarettes exceed two billion units. It is proposed to modify this section to provide as follows:            4. Each Company participating in the T.I.T.L. shall make an annual payment of Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00) for purposes of defraying the expenses of operating the laboratory. The balance of the expenses of operating the laboratory shall be allocated among the participating Companies whose respective annual sales of USA tax-paid cigarettes exceed                      CONFIDENTIAL: MINNESOTA TOBACCO LITIGATION XIMN 210425"
"Tobacco800";"tjr72f00-page02_2";"NextPage";"      two billion units. Each Company responsible for additional expenses shall be assessed for the per-centage of such additional expenses as is determined by using that Company's total annual sales of USA tax-paid cigarettes as the numerator and the total annual sales of USA tax-paid cigarettes of all Companies responsible for additional expenses as the denominator. In determining the allocation for additional expenses, the total sales of USA tax-paid cigarettes shall be determined by using, as sales figures, the estimated domestic cigarette consumption by Company based on the latest annual Maxwell Report (Maxwell Associates, Richmond, Virginia). It is further proposed that this modification take effect as of the first day of July, 1975. If the foregoing modification is acceptable to you, I would appreciate your signifying your. agreement by signing the carbön copy of this letter and returning it to me.

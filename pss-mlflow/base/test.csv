Subfractions fror-, preparative gas chromatography were analyzed by fused silica capällarv GC/mass spectrometry. Experimental detail.y are described 3n the Appendix. Figure I shows the preparative gas chromatogram. Table 1 lists the oder transition observed organoleptically at the GC exit port during, the period each subfraction was being eluted. Table II lists in the order of increasing GC retention time the components identified by capillary GC/MS. Components tefitatively identified are indicated by an asterisk (*). Relative abundance of the identified components vithin each subfraction is indicated by peak sizes: +, small; ++, medium; and +++, large.                                                                         ' Amadori compounds from various amino acids and glucose or fructose have been found by many food flavor investigators to be the flavor precursors in Maillard reaction. The fact that Amadori compounds are more polar and have higher molecular weights would probubly make them stay longer in the finished tobacco products thsn the volatile flavor molccules. Synthetic methods and isolation procedures for Amadori compounds have been obtained through literature searebes. Studies on che effect(s) of Amadori compounds on cigarettes to produee the desirable Maillard reaction aroma seera worth-while pursuing. TCH/bfw                   ce: Dr. R. M. Ma t u1i S      Mr. M.

Ttiirty gratis of reaction ”A"" mixture wert mixed thoroughly with 300 ml of methanol/water (70/30) and filternd with suction. The methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure, The sample was extracted successively with 400 ml each of diethyl ether, Chloroform, and toluene. The aqueous layer was concentrated about 5 fold for preparative gas chromatography. Preparative Gas Chromatography About 30 ul of the above sample was chromaLographed on a 10 ft, x 4 mm I.D. glass column pacl^ed with 15% Carbowax 20M on 100/120 mesh AW/DMCS chromosorb W using an HP-7624 gas Chromatograph. The column temperature was p.rogrammed from 60cC to 230°C at 4°C/min. and held at the upper limit. Helium was used as carrier gas at 50 ml/min. The subfractlons w^re collected in 2 mm glass U-tubes cooled in an ethanol/dry iee bath. Twenty ul of methylene Chloride was introduced to wash the inner wall of the U-tube immediately after collection. The tubes were then sealed at the ends with parafilm and kept in a dry ice box until analyzed by capiliary GC/MS. Fused Silica Capiliary GC/MS Each of the subfractions collected in the U-tubes was further chromatographed qn a 50m x 0.2 mm I.D. fused silica capiliary column of SF-2100 in a Finnigan 4023 GC/MS/data System. With helium as a carrier gas at 1-3 ml/min. the column temperature was programmed from 40°C (held for 4 min.) to 200 C at a rate of 2-4 C/min. Electron iropact mode of MS was carried out on all the samples while Chemical ionization mode on some samples to verify molecular weight assignment.                                     569204488"

Sydney H.S.w. 2001 Australla Dear Mr. Nicholls: I am writing ln response to your 1 etter of May 14, 1973, conceming ethylene oxide and propylene oxide treatment of tobacco. Our current Interest is ln the use of propylene oxide as a raeana of lowering nlcotlne content of tobacco, More speciflcally in response to your request, our chemlsts have found no halohydrlne ln tobacco or smoke of treated tobaccos. Details of these findlngs will be forth* comlng ln raport form. Several years ago we experimented with ethylene oxtde as a tobacco sterilant. Ethylene oxide treatment of leaf under pressure generally caused a reductlon in bacterlal and yeast populationa. A variety of pure culture bacterla wäre reduced to a non-viable state by ethylene oxide. There was no meaaurable effect on alkaloidB of flue-cured tobacco but a slight reductlon did occur when burley tobacco was treated with ethylene oxide. Upon room storage for approximately 30 days the alkalolds ln this burley tobacco returned to the original amounts, 1 am enclosing several related reprints which you may find of beneflt. There ls also equlpment available from U. S. Manufacturerc for gaseous Sterilisation work. Sincerely, LEG/jn                                               620136725"

How to reselect   strain with specific activity, if                  the method will   disclose the process or purpose                  ascribed in the'patent application.          The culture should be sent as slant cultures (minimum of two) from which 30 lyophilized tubes will be prepared. This will minimize variations and mutation. A letter confirming receipt and giving a number designation and disposition of the culture will be sent promptly.          According to existing regulations the culture will be immediately available to the public. However, a list of such cultures is not published. Only the depositor, NRRL and the U.S. Patent Office will know of its existence until the patent is issued.          Dr.     Hesseltine advised that we not state the NRRL culture number in    foreign patent applications     unless absolutely necessary because many foreign    patents issue more quickly than U.S. Patents, thereby disclosing availability of the culture.          Cultures, such as our #262, which are subject to continuous Variation and require periodic reselection by special techniques to maintain the high activ-ities claimed in patent applications, can be redeposited at the time of patent issuance giving details of the method of reselection.    cc: Dr. Senkus         Dr. Pheil          Dr. Nielson      Miss Margaret Long 50808 4827"

As you may know, we have heen plagued by an off-taste from cigarettes made with Eousta ' r; Velvet Paper which contains hydrated magnesium oxioe- Einte you have bee:: successful using fillers other than MgiOHJj to prodnee a paper which reduces S.'S-TPM equivalent to Velvet, this offers an opportunity to determine whether the off-taste is specific to the MgtOH.)^ filier or whether it is a result of the sidestream reducing mechanism.  If it is possible, could you provide us with some samples of paper which reduce SS-TPM similarly to Velvet (a, 50%), but which do not contain magnesium compounds. This would allow us to hand roll a few samples to compare with Velvet. One or two 45 cm strips of each sample would be sufficient. Once the cigarettes were tested, we would be happy to share the results.  Thank you. Sincerely F. K.. St.Charles  FK.S/sek/324  04961  cc:   Dr. C. I. Ayers        Mr. E. E. Kohnhorst  682239528"

MaynorVbitn 27 Karch 1964                   Evaluation of Hvdifved BWC Carbon (Fehling Solution Modified) for Filtration of Ctmdeasibles in the G ;s Phase.            A suggested modification of BWC carbon (coosisting of 70% BVC, 20% Na^CO-j and 10% CuSO, * 51^)         evaluated for fültrat'.on of the condensiblas in the gas            phaHe. This mixture was speculated to stmulata the action of Fehling's solution on aldehydes. Aldehydes react with Fehlingb solution furming sodiuni salts whlle reducing the cuprie van to the cuprous ion.            The fXltration evaltiation was performed in two ways. The modified carbon was raade Into filter rods (30% loading) and conipared vith normal 30% BWC rods by smoking 20 mm sectlons on Avalon tobacco eectioas. The second raethod consieted of eandwiching 30 mg of the powdered carbon (both normal and modified) between two 10 am sections of white acetate 6/5 Pt. and smoking on an Avalon tobacco section. The 30 mg loading simulates the content of an 8 ram section of carbon rod at the 30% level ln an Avalon c'garette.            The deta obtained by both smoking methode showed that the modified BWC carbon was lass effictent than normal BWC carbon. The short gas residente time and the non-aqueous modification probably circuvwent the action of the basic copper sulfate on the aldehydes.

(for details cf. meetings notes dated November 4, 1981). b) Grimmer experiment    The task force will visit Prof. Grimmer at his laboratory, February 8, 1982. TFA meeting in Hamburg, November 14, 1981 a) Discussion with TKR representatives:    - TKR propagates the addition of urea to tobacco for the reduction of BaP and nitrosamines.    - They gave a poor performance and their intentions appeared rather questionable. b) Dr. Scherer suggested to do Chemical and biochemical investigations with cigarettes that have differing nicotine and nitrate levels    in order to invalidate upcoming results by Bock. After a very tedious and time consuming discussion it was decided that Dr. Scherer should prepare two alternative research protocols early next year. c) A draft copy of the manuscript for the first publication on nitrosamines (nitrosamine levels in public places) was handed out to    the participants. RJR gave input in the meantime. d) The VdC had been informed by Prof. Körte that he would not include the paper by Scherer/ßarkemeyer in his upcoming EC report, perhaps in the first update (scheduled for Feb. 82) since their paper ""did not add to existing knowledge"".

Costs      will probably  amount        -                            DM 500,000.- for      the preliminary study,        -                      DM 5.1 mio. for       the main study,     d)  A   revised research    protocol will be prepared  by Dr. Scherer.     Meeting of the TFA task force ""Schievelbein Munich Study"" ln Hamburg, TTecemberT, T981     Prof. Schievelbein and his co-workers attended this meeting. Results of the pilot study were discussed. Main points of interest were:  I a) Data pibtained the pilot study cannpt conclusively be interpreted.     b)  iNext steps will be        - a final report will be prepared and sent to the partidpantsi: i for review,          Dr. Scherer will prepare two research protocols which shall des-crlbe two alternative designs for a (potential, still to be decided upon) main study,        - next meeting will probably be held in February or March, 1982.  6.

RJR objected to this procedure since the ASFC was not officially informed by the VdC. Therefore, it was agreed upon that Prof. Adlkofer will contact Prof, ßaettig and Or. Lichti, director of the ASFC - RJR shall inform the Scientific Commission of the ASFC about the Intention of the VdC.        OS then contacted Prof. ßaettig, who emphasized that he would prefer officlal information of the Scientific Commission of the ASFC.

O* Jensen Research Supervisor Research Division P. Lorillard Company, Inc. 2525 East Harket Street Greenaboro, N. C. Dear Dr. jensen: This report is to lnforro you of the Principal evdnts which transpired during the visit of Dr. Spears and myself to the laboratory of Dr. wynder at the Sloan*-Kettering Institute, New York City, during the week of October 19th to october 23rd, 1959. The purpose of the visit was to observe the three-day method for determination of polycyclic compounds — principally 3,4—benzpyrene - in cigarette smoke condensate recently developed by Dr. D. Hoffmann and his assoclates. The followlng paragraphs contain a detailed account of the procedure used by these workers. A sample of tar which weighs 10-20 g. after drying overnight in vacuum over calcium chloride is completely dissolved in 20 ml. of cyclohexane saturated with a mixture of uethanol and water (4:1) and transferred to a 250 ml. separatory funnel. The last traces of tar are rinsed from the flask into the separatory funnel with two 10 ml. portions of cyclohexane. This cyclohexane solution is then extracted three times with a solution of methanol-water (4:1) and the alcoholic portions dlscarded. The remainlng cyclohexane solution is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at a temperature not exceeding 50 C. The resulting brown residue is redissolved in 40 ml. of cyclohexane saturated with nitroraethane, and this solution is extracted in a 250 ml. separatory funnel with four 40 ml. portions of nitromethane. The nitromethane extracts are combined and evaporated to dryneas under vacuum at less than 50°C."

O- Jensen - 2 - October 28, 1959 The resulting residue Is then dissolved ln a minimmn amount of n-hexane and transferred quantitatively (by rInsing with small amounts of n—hexane) to a previously prepared silica column. The column is prepared by pouring a slurry o£ 200 mesh deactlvated silica gel into an 18-20 mm. tube with a pyrex wool or cotton plug at the bottom. The deactlvated silica gel is prepared by washing 200 mesh silica first with absolute methanol and then with n-hexane. The quantlty of silica gel used for the column should be approxi-mately 30-40 times the weight of the residue from the last evaporation. The silica column after application of the sample is eluted with n-hexane. The first fraction is collected until fluorescence is noted in the eluate. Fraction II is collected until the color of the fluorescence changes from yellow to blue. The succeeding fractionö (XII through VII) are cut at approximately 50 ml. intervals or when a change ln the color of the fluorescence is noted. Fractlons VIII through X are eluted with a solution of benzene ln n-hexane (1:4). Benzo(a)pyrene is in fractlons V, VI and VII. These fractlons are evaporated to dryness under a stream of nltrogen, and each is redissolved ln a minimum quantlty of benzene. These Solutions are then applied in the usu&l manner (by streaXing) to half sheets of acetylated filter paper, making sure by several rlnslngs and inspections under U.V. light that the transfers from the flasks to the paper are quantitative. A known sample of benzo(a)pyrene is spotted near the edge of the papers as a reference. The papers are suspended with the bottom edges in a solution ether—water-methanol (4:1:4) and allowed to stand ovemight. The papers are then drled and the portlons corresponding to the known benzo(a)pyrene spots are cut out. These cut—out portlons are placed in small Saxhlet extractors under nitrogen pressure and extracted with benzene-alcöhol (4:1) until no more fluorescence can be seen on the paper under U.V. light. The benzene extracts are cambined, evaporated to dryness, redissolved and rechromatographed on acetylated paper. If a Sharp Separation is still not obtained, it may be necessary to repeat the paper chromatography a third time; however, one repetition of this step is usually sufficient for the analysis of benzo (a)pyrene, The purity of the benzo (a)pyrene is checked by U.V. spectroscopy after its extraction from the second 00066287"

When suf ficient purity has been obtained, the eactract is filtered over a small column (5-7 tau. dia. x 30-50 mm. lang) of siliea gel to remove paper flbres and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The resldue is redissolved in a measured volume of cyclohexane and the concentration o£ benzo(a)pyrene is determined from the U.V. spectrum of this solution. All solvents used in the above procedure. and the paper chromatograms should be protected from U.V. light. ""benzo(a)pyrene,M he has determined the loss during the analysis to be in the ränge of 30-40% of the original benzo(a)pyrene present in the tar. It is, therefore, feit that in order for the method to be used with thj^desired analytical accuracy, a known concentration of c , labeled ""benzo(a)pyrene,"" should be added at the beginnlng of the analysis and the loss determined for each sample run. Dr. Hoff mann has not as yet determined ln which step or steps of this procedure the losses occur, but It is his thought that the greatest loss is in the removal of the sample from the paper chromatograms. In general, we feel that Dr. Hoffmann*s method is a good one and generally applicable to our present needs, although mlnor variations might be made toadapt the method to specific needs. Both Dr. Spears and myself wlsh to express our appreciation for the complete Cooperation given us by Dr. Hoffmann and his staff both in the form of answers to our questions and data obtained by them.

Note on ‘‘2."":  •  Dr.     Changeux is the last author of the article by Picciotto et aL  •  Dr.     Changeux         describes “positive action of nicotine'', namely, as a cognition enhancer      as   weil as an          anxiolytic (page 3; there are obvious mistakes in the transcript such as      describing an                 anxiolytic to “increase” anxiety). Since ß24acking mutant mice show      higher abiltty of iearning than the wiid-type (see “1."" attached), it can be argued that the subunlt functions as an “inhibitor” of Iearning. In this case the abiiity of nicotine to facilitate iearning cannot be explained,  • Dr. Changeux appears to think that there are several ievels of “addiction” (page 4).

Gourley         Tanasa, our licensee in Peru, has requested a limited analysis of ""Tabacool"" to evaluate Claims made in regard to this material. This was accomplished by obtaining WINSTON KS blend which had been prccessed in the factory to the point of making cigarettes, and dividing into two segments to ensure blend uniformity.         One segment (L-11010-B) was sprayed with 0.5% ""Tabacool"" based on tobacco weight at 12.9% moisture, dispersed in a solution of 3 parts alcohol and 2 parts propylene glycol. The other segment L-11010-A was sprayed with just alcohol and propylene glycol at the same ratio tobe utilized as a control.         Cigarettes were fabricated from each segment for evaluation by the Expert Smoking Panel and Chemical analyses.

One part was used green, one was dried by artificial heet and the third allowed to dry by hanging in the shade.            The smoke from the leaves possessed the same odor and teste independent of the way of drying.           ^            The dried leaves were blendefd with Cigarette tobacco in the proportion of 1     3?o, and 5c/o. Cigarettes made fron these blends have a decidely unpleasant odor and taste reminding one of burning urine. The tung leaves are not suitable for use in a Cigarette designed to give pleasure in smoking.

Eden, NC 27288-8120  Dear Ms. Tayior:  The Philip Morris family of Companies is changing. As we enter the 21* Century, we are committed to communicating more openty about who we are, what we do, and what we stand for. Our brands are probably familiar to you — household names like Kraft cheeses, Post cersals, Maxwell House coffee, Jeil-O desserts, Oscar Mayer meats, Altoids mints, Miller beer and Marlboro cigarettes. Our products are in nine out of ten American homes. And, we are 57,000 people in the U.S. alone — neighbors, parents and citizens with a 40-year commitment to giving backto the communities in which we live and work. Because of the controversy surrounding our tobacco business for the past several years, however, we know we have seemed out of step with the public's expectations of us.  We want you to know we are redoubiing our efforts to do a better job of listening to the public’s concerns, working to develop concrete Solutions, and communicating openiy and aocurateiy about our entire family cf Companies, our products and our people.  Some of these efforts include:  • Leading efforts to prevent youth smoking and encourage responsible drinking. For example, we have a Youth Smoking Prevention department with an annual budget of $100 million to create and support programs like the ""We Card” program, which heips prevent the sale of cigarettes to minors. Our “Think When You Drink"" program aims at preventing underage drinking, drunk driving and alcohol abuse.  • Continuing to build on our 40-year history of helping to meet immediate human needs. From fighting hunger to supporting victims of domestic violence, from funding arts and cultural programs io providing disaster relief and humanitarian aid, we are committed to giving back to the communities where we live and work.  • Finally, opening broader iines of communication with the public. For the last several months, Company representatrves have been speaking to such diverse groups as parent/teacher associations, civic groups, community organizations, hospital associations and press clubs. We have also launched a new advertising campaign entltled “Working to make a difference. The peopie of Philip Morris."" It focuses on our Company, our responsibility as a manufacturer and marketer and our community involvement. And, we kicked off an informative new websrte, www.philipmorris.com, that includes a host of information on the products, the principles and the people of Philip Morris.  I hope you will take a moment to review the enclosed materials and to visit our website. If you are skeptical, I ask you to take a second look; judge us not just by what we say, but by what we are doing and what we will do over the coming months and years.  On behalf of the Philip Morris family of Companies, I want to thank you for tetting us share our phiiosophy and for taking a moment to get to know us a little better. Sincerely, Geoffrey C.

MacKinnon     RE:   SALEM  FÜLL FLAVOR  BUSINESS       BUILDING   TEST RECOMMENDATION Recommendation The Brand recommends an investment of $953M to determine through test marketing the viability of implementing a national business building program on SALEM FULL FLAVOR. January is recommended for Start of test marketing. Funds are available in current Brand budgets. Program Objectives 1.  Maintain Brand's share of category      which will require increasing      volume (+2.5%) and share of    market  (+0.1 share point). 2.  Increase Brand contribution     long term. 3.  Achieve a reasonable payout     period  (less than 3 years)  for this      incremental investment. Strategies/Rationale 1. Increase total SALEM FULL FLAVOR marketing spending in Year I by 55% ($8MM).      • Previous media heavy-up tests indicate the Brand is re-sponsive to additional spending.      •  50% increase required to read a significant share change.      • Results in $12MM Brand contribution increase over a 3-year period despite increased spending in the out years and payout in 18 months if objectives are met. See Exhibit I. 2. Concentrate the incremental funds against young adult smokers 34 year olds).      • Newport and Kool's high developments among young adults appear to be the primary cause for their category share growth and notably, Newport's growth within the total market. SALEM FULL FLAVOR, however, is underdeveloped versus competition among this segment since spending is executed broadly. See Exhibit II. (18- 6ti00S"
"Tobacco800";"vjk79d00-page04_2";"NextPage";"Ms. S. A. MacKinnon 2 October 11, 1979 Strategies/Rationale (Cont'd.) 2. (Cont'd.)     • SALEM FULL FLAVOR has the potential to attract/hold young adult smokers.         - Young adults demonstrate a greater propensity to switch to/ stay with SALEM FULL FLAVOR than the older smoker.            The older smokers (35+) account for all of the Brand's net change of -8.5%. See Exhibit III.            The product is competitive and performs as well or better among young adults vs. the older smoker. See Exhibit IV.         - Advertising recalls above the full flavor norm among young adults. See Exhibit V.            Young adult focus groups indicated a preference for SALEM's ""High Country"" campaign vs. competitors. 3. Spend incremental funds as follows:     • Media:     $6MM                                                   Increase Vs.                               $          %          Current            Magazine         $4.3MM       72%                           +51%            00H                          1.7MM                      28% +40%                Targeted to young adults (Impressions increased +59%). See Exhibit VI.            - Efficient; OOH creates market presence.            - Best reproduction of advertising.     • Promotion:     $2MM targeted intercept sampling of 20's.            70% increase vs. current budget.            SALEM FULL FLAVOR proven responsive to sampling achieving a 14.1% follow-up purchase rate. See Exhibit VII.         - Partner with WINSTON FULL FLAVOR targeted 35% aged 21-24/ 65% aged 25-34.       90% selective/10% environmental sampling.     • Concentrate incremental OOH/sampling in high BDI markets with additional print national in scope."

I look forward to seeing you then on the 14th of March in Phoenix, Arizona» I would be interested to learn what day, or days, will be needed for the peer review of applications that have been submitted.

DD Is the deformed diameter of the rod when compressed using a weight of 300g ovar a 12mra wide foot. Hardness is the difference in uncompressed and compressed diameter. The smaller the number, the harder the rod. I have also included a piece of latex tubing you can use to construct a holder for pressure drop measurements. A sketch is attached. You should be able to obtain more tubing from a medical supply house, If not, let me know.

The speculative comps used in the presentation are not to be considered the final Creative submissions on this theme.                           A great many issues remain to be resolved by LCF&L and ATCo.                    II.   Strategie Issues                      A)  How can we make this a proprietarily AMERICAN program. With enough spending there could just as well be the Doral or Viceroy ""funny animals"". How do we make them solely/clearly ours? (eg: Is there a ""Great American/ Proud American"" connection?)                      B)  Is the cigarette in the mouth a critical element? Can we/should go ahead with this Creative if, for whatever reason, the cigarette is ruled out? Should we conduct preliminary consumer research to test reaction to this type of visual (as well as the campaign in general)?                      C)  Where do you see this campaign going? Can it build/drive a significant Brand imagery and point of difference?                         SIX STAMFORD FORUM P.O.

"Tobacco800";"wbv90c00-page02_2";"NextPage";"Mr. Doug Bomeisler March 30, 1989 Page two III) Tactlcal Issues   A) How should AMERICAN Filters be incorporated into what had been conceived as an AMERICAN Lights test?   B) How many different executions should be prepared? And should they run in succession or rotation? Which specific shots are available to us? The final ""price"" copy lines also need to be discussed.   C) Leaming from prior problems with stock photography, can we check to see if we might catch flack from either the slide house or the original photographer for ""altering"" the shots by retouching the cigarette onto the photo subject?   D) Apropos of recent problems with the background on some of the new MALIBU units, let's be absolutely certain that placement of the government mandatories is carefully considered and reflected on the final comps.   E) Production cost and timing estimates will also be required. You've indicated that you'11 review these issues with the appropriat Agency personnel.

TU The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch United States Senator Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20610-6275 Dear Senator Hatch:            I am enclosing answers to the       questions of Senators Leahy   and Kohl that you forwarded                 to me  on July 28, 1997. The answers have been prepared as responses by all of the Companies that are parties to the settlement, thus they reflect a joint industry response rather than the response of only one Company or a personal response by me. Each of the cigarette manufacturers has determined to respond to Senator Kennedy's question individually and individual Company responses to those questions will be delivered today or tomorrow to you and to Senator Kennedy.            I personally regret the                  delay that has been entailed in responding to these questions. I would have hoped that responses could have been completed earlier than now. The attention that members of the Committee have paid to this matter is deeply appreciated. I hope that the tardiness of the responses has not excessively complicated the work of the Committee.

The limiting or steady state solution R-rl03n C0TV simply states that there is so much tar available per cubic meter. The important issue is the human-smoke interaction and therefore is the one that must bc addressed before ""leaping to conclusions"". The author’s model obviously does not include this interaction. Critical points which are not incorporated in the model are: 1.   R. yields tar in ug/m3; what is the partiele size distribuiion associated with A? Sidestream smoke tends to coogulate rapidly thus forming large particlcs. Taking this point into consideration leads one to question the meaning of the rate equation solution. i’SsasTO&s"

The entry surface area of the respiratory system is relatively small (in comparison to total surface available to smoke particles) thus not only particle size but effective concentration enters into the problem.   3. Because of the room, coagulation rates, respiratory cross sections, gradient effects in the room cannot be ignored. This leads to strong questioning of the homogenous mixing assmnption.   4. The validity of ""what if we assume EPA outdoor Standards and apply them indoors"" is certainly open to debate. Since these Standards are set rigidly to considcr dilution, wind, distance to detectors, they heavily overweigh the indour Situation, Under these Standards, cooking or dusting in one's own home would probably violate one of the levels.

Much better Chromatographie resolution and a 25% saving in analysis time have been achieved. This is part of an effort to set up an in-house method for carotenoid determination. INTRODUCTION Many important tobacco flavor components have been found to be derived from carotenoids.However, studies^-^ also indicated that tobacco carotenoid content reached a maximum at maturity and decreased drastically during curing and further processing. Workers have been interested in the determination of:     1. Ways of breeding and cultivating to increase tobacco carotenoid content.     2. Proper harvest time and practices to maximize tobacco carotenoid concentration.     3. Optimal processing and storage conditions to maintain carotenoid content in tobaccos.     4. Physical, Chemical, or biological conditions for controlled degradation of carotenoids, which would lead to desirable           flavors.     5. Ways to incorporate carotenoid flavors to achieve desirable smoking properties. An in-house method for carotenoid determination can certainly facilitate the above-mentioned activities.                                          620607685"
"Tobacco800";"wdf61f00-page2_2";"NextPage";"- 2 -  MATERIALS AM) METHODS  The tobacco carotenoid extract (FLX) was obtained from Dr. V. Heemann at BAT-Hamburg. Equipment and columns used in higb performance liquid dhromatography (HPLC) were purchased from Waters Associates (Milford, Massachusetts 01757). These comprised two solvent delivery punrps (M6000A), a solvent programmer (M660), an injector (U6K), a column compression module (RCM-100), and a UV detector (M44Q). Separation was carried out using a silica column (Radiai-Pak, 8mm i.d. x 10 cm, particle size 5 i'tt. with a guard coLumn (Guard-Pak Silica).  HPLC-grade solvents (Fisher Scientific Co.) were used as a mobile pbase.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  HPLC cbromatograms of the tobacco carotenoid extract FLX are sbown in Figure 1 by BAT-Hamburg prodeedure^ and in Figure 2 by B&W improved procedure. Peak identities in Figure 2 were based on the original BAT-Hamburg assignment as labeled in Figure 1. Marked improvement on Chromatographie resolution was evident in areas between lutein and zeaxanthin, among the members in the zeaxantbin cluster, and between violaxanthin and its eis-isomer. Improvement on the Identification and quantification of these important xanthophylls (oxygenated carotenoids) can be expected from this improved Separation.  Further work on this project will include a precision study and Identification of major unknown xanthophylls in the extract. T. C. Hsieb TCH/sek 0007p Attachments cc: Dr. J. N. Jewell          Mr. M.

We have made tremendous progress in this area by 1) showing that CD40 transmits Signals to B cells that induce isotype switching, 2) demonstrating that patients with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome (HIGMX-1) have mutations in CD40L, 3) detailing the genomic structure of mouseand human CD40L. Recently we have embarked on CD40L and CD40 knockouts using a relatively simple complementation approach by injecting embryonic stem cells with knocked out genes into blastocysts of RAG2 deficient mice. These studies will allow us to define the role of CD40 in immune function and have an animal model of HIGMX-1 to test novel modalities of treatment.       As you may know I have under review a grant resubmission with the Tobacco Research Foundation dealing with structure function relationship of FcyRI. We were told that we could submit a new grant for the November 30, 1993 deadline if our pending grant is tumed down. I would very much appreciate receiving a grant application blank in case I need to submit for the November 30, 1993 deadline. Raif S. Geha, M.D.  /bp"

SUCCCSSOR TO TUE TOBACCO INDUSTRY RESEARCH COMMITTEE 633 T1IJRD AVENUE NEW YORK. N. Y. 10017                                                                    October lkt Dr. T. C. Tso, Plant Physiologist Tobacco Quality Investigations Crops Research Division Agricultural. Research Service U. S. Department of Agriculture Beltsville, Maryland_ . Dear Dr. Tso:            We have received your letter of September 30, 19&hf conceming . ""Federal-State health oriented research programs on tobacco"". In particular you raise the question as to what Chemical components in tobacco ""are considered to be potentially health hazardous and should be studied"".            I an sure you realize, particular ly after the Lexington Kentucky Conference, that in the present state of knowledge it is really impossible to compile any such list of ""potentially hazardous components"" of tobacco. The reason, of course, is that the presumed dangers of cigarette smoking are conjectural in nature, being inferred largely from statistical relationships by methods that are still under question and challenge by many of our leading statisticians. There is no disease whose relationship to cigarette smoking as a significant causal or contributory factor has been convineingly demonstrated by clinical or experimental methods. Still less has any contributory mechanism been traced out in detail or shown to be due.to.any specific ingredient of cigarette smoke.                                     •»     '            This certainly does not mean that it is impossible to do useful analyiical work by vay of stock-piling knowledge that may eventually become important. It must, however, be realized, as someone pointed out in Lexington, that such studies can only be based upon ""limited working hypotheses“ or ""speculative presurrrotions"" that may prove to have no foundation. As .was said""there ""opportunities to waste time on futile leads are enormous"". Fortunately the by-products of scientific work so often become more important than the original goals that good scientific effort is not likely to be wasted in the long run. On this clearly defir.od basis we would approve competent efforts to accumulate new knowledge of the components of the tobacco plant as affected by strain difference, soil components, weather conditions, genetic factors, ifertilizers, insecticides, plant diseases, curing methods, ageing etc."
"Tobacco800";"whz29d00-page03_2";"NextPage";"October lU, I96U Such studies have, indeed, lonlg been conducted by the U. S. Department of Agriculture and xnany state experiment stations.            In its own program of research, the Council is mainly biologically oriented. Its approach, in general, is first to study the effects'of whole, normal.cigarette smoke, in as nearly as possible the condition in which human smokers encounter it, on various biological Systems. Second, when effects are found that may be potentially related to health or disease, the plan is to evaluatc such effects in the total physiological economy of the animal and then, finally, to trace any significant and undesireable effects, if possible, to the specific ingredients of the smoke that cause them. At this point, when and if reached, we would have a satisfactory basis.and incentive for looking into the origins of such a component from the constituents of the tobacco itself during the combustion process.            At present we are still engaged almost wholly in studies within the first two of the three phases stated above.            Although our program has many ramifications, as perusal of our latest Annual Report (copy enclosed) will show, we can illustrate our approach further by reference to studies on carcinogenesis.            In this area also, we feel that it is actually• whole, normal cigarette smoke in.the form and condition in which it'is encountered by humans, that really needs to be tested for any activity it may conceivably have as a direct contact carcinogen or cocarcinogen. Studies of condensates are far less satisfactory since the opportunity for changes in Chemical composition and physical properties that occurs on condensation and preservation may be very significant. YThere it bas seemed necessary to use such condensates as a temporary expe.dient, we have defined and controlled the methods of production and preservation-with great care in order to make these products at least reproducible.            A large number of bioassay Systems have been devised and tested, mostly with such condensates, in the hope of producing a quick and reliable assay method of the kind for which great need was expressed in Lexington. No system has yet been shown to be wholly satisfactory, though one or two still look somewhat hopeful. Other possible methods need to be studied and, where promising, • compared with and evaluated in relation to those already in use. The Council is vitally interested v in this type of research.                 %                                 .            The experience with such assays as have been studied does not support the assumption that polynuclear hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke are playing any significant role in human lung cancer genesis or indeed The Council For Tobacco Research -U. S. A. Dr. T. C. Tso     U. S. Department of Agriculture       - 2 -"

Department of Agriculture             - 3 -               October lU,  1S6U that such smoke really functions in humans as a direc.t Chemical carcinogen. Hence we have not feit that major efforts to reduce further the infinitesimal levels of polynuclear hydrocarbons in smoke were likely to be productive of any real benefits. If others, however, wisn to try removing, diminishing or neutralizing the possible effects of such substances on the basis of what they believe to be justifiable assumptions, and provided that any modifications proposed can be shown clearly to produce no other change potentially deleterious to health, we could not disapprove. At present the limitations of our bioassay methods make such assurance difficult. We could give other illustrations in addition to this discussion of possible carcinogenicity, such, for_ example as ciliostasis, but the general perspective is much the same.            You will be able to apply the general statements that we have nade, to the specific cases of the components suggested in your list as candidates for analytical study in tobacco leaf samples. We would applaud the acquisition of Information on all these ingredients as additfons to the stock-pile of knowledge that should eventually be useful in one manner or another. But there is no possible assurance at present that any of these will ever turn out to be significantly related to health problems.            In the special case of additives to Cigarette tobacco, we have feit that these were quite unlikely to bear any relation to the health picture. The reason for this feeling is that no such additives are used in Britain where the incidence of diseases held to be related statistically to cigarette smoking is, nevertheless, much higher than in the United States.            The Council will be glad to be kept in touch with the program of the U. S. Department of Agriculture and the .National Cancer Institute by correspondence and by personal contact. In;turn \re shall be glad to furnish those agencies with any desired data or information from our own ; program either now or in the future.

This preliminary round of testing was conducted to identify candidates for inclusion in the more extensive M.A.R.C. testing, which ie 'currently undervay. A final product deci-sion will be made in May for both 85'a and 100's based on the M.A.R.C. results. Summary of Key Findings • On© of aix 85mm prototypes (Prototype ""G"") met the designated action Standards. Excluding ""G"", the prototypes were generally perceived to have an exccsa of mcnthol relative to competition, and to be harder to draw. a Prototype ""G"" was rated superior (action Standard of parity) to Triumph overall and among both tested sub-groups. Pritnary attribute advantages were strength of taste, mcnthol level, coolnesa, draw and not lcaving a had aftertaste. Prototype ""G"" was a 4 mg., single-stage filter product. « Neither 100'a Prototype achieved action Standards. Prototype ""B"" (5 mg., dual-st8ge) achieved the Standard of superiority versus Carlton overall and among SALEM LIGHTS smokers, but was rated at parity among defined competitive smokers. ln contrast to the 85's products, both 100's prototypes were generally perceived as not having enough mcnthol relative to tobacco taste. Subsequcnt Action ' Although action Standards were met, the filter of the 85*s ""G"" prototype was taodified (mcnthol flavoring added) prior to its inclusion with three other 85's prototypes for M.A.R.C. Testing. This action was taken by Tobacco Development based on internal panel testa which showed tha modified ""G"" prototype to he preferred to the original vereion."

The same was true of your April 2 editorial, ""Thy Neighbor’s Lungs."" Dr. Lenfant wrote:    ""Generally speaking, the evidence that passive smoking in a general environment has health effects remairis sparse, incomplete and sometimes unconvineing."" He went on to point out that Mthere is no proof as yet that the reported reduetion in airways function has any physiological or clinical consequences. The study is confined to only one aspect of an issue too complex to be resolved on such a limited basis."" v. TV;        .. .■            t       -     -  •. if ’.pj & The conclusions reached by Drs. White and Froeb also are at odds with the latest judgment of the U. S. Surgeon General. His 1979 Report on Smoking and Health, which addressed this issue, found: ""Healthy nonsmokers exposed to cigarette smoke have little or no Physiologie response to the smoke, and what response does occur may be due to psychological faetors."" Clearly, the California study, which will now be subject to objective and critical review within the scientific community, should not be considered the ""final word."" For the Times to advocate public policy which would dictate social behavior and discriminate against over a third of the adult population on the • Y basis of this study, seems highly premature and totally out-of- &' character."

This measure requires Wholesale and retail dealers to take an inventory of all cigarettes on the effective date. Therefore, at the close of business on May 30, you are to take a complete inventory of all packages of 20s in your possession bearing Rhode Island state tax stamps. This inventory must be mailed to this office May 30. On June 2, we must remit the tax due to the State of Rhode Island.            If your territory includes another state in addition to Rhode Island and you are working in that state on May 30, you should not, of course, have any Rhode Island taxed merchandise on hand. However, you should inform us by letter to this effect.            The quantity of 20s reported on your inventory should be raulti-plied by 5 cents and this amount should be deducted from your Expense Account. Our Tax Department will remit the same amount to the State of Rhode Island.            Beginning on the effective date, you are to seil all merchandise in your possession at the new increased prices.            Please retain this letter as proof of the fact that the new tax rate has been complied with in the event you are questioned by an agent of the State Tax Commission. 990055915 PRODUCED FROM B&W WEB SITE"

Box 1115 Alpine New Jersey 07620 USA Department of Pharmacology St. Mary’s Hospital Medical School (Universit3' of London) Norfolk Place London \V2 1PG Telephone: 01-723 1252   Q      j         - -^1^8 Dear Charlie, Since returning to London, my colleague Jackie Pontin and I have given more thought to how best to capitalize upon the studies on high and low familial risk of lung cancer which are just being set up with Henry Lynch. Since Dr. Lynch will be taking the trouble of mounting the field studies in various types of ""high"" and ""low"" risk cancer pedigrees, I feel strongly that we should not miss the opportunity of establishing immortal cell lines on each of the 400 subjects which we will study. Such is my conviction that I believe these studies should be started immediately and not constrained by my move to Newcastle. Here is my proposal: Omaha will be recruiting 400 subjects, each phenotyped with debrisoquine in vivo : they will fall into four groups of equal size; sporadic lung cancers with no other cancer family history (""low"" risk), sporadic lung cancers with positive cancer family history, colon cancer-prone families with high and low family histories. These latter two types of pedigree are very interesting from the following point of view, that of the 2000 members of the 10 kindreds, there is only one known case of lung cancer. Immortalized EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B-cell lines will providc a future resource for studying the molecular genetics of lung cancer risk. We are already looking in cohorts with cDNA probes and RPLP analysis for various P450 polymorphisms which we believe may bear upon lung cancer risk. At relatively small additional cost (supplemented by CTR?) Dr. Lynch could mail us small batches of fresh blood for B-cell transformation. I cannot see how this should add more than about $5 to the cost of each sample collection, or $2000 in ioto, but he needs to be asked. At our cnd we shall need Ms. Pontin’s salary with on-costs. ($45,000 for 18 months) together with consumable costs for cell transf ormation, culture and cryopreservation of $75 per cell line (cf. $500 NIH contracted - out cost!), i.e. $30,000. In addition, we would need to purchase a liquid nitrogen Dewar for storing the cell lines ($1600). The total cost of the project for the first year would thus be $51,600 (2/3 $45,000 + 2/3 $30,000 + $1,600).

MELBOURNE 3000 Geoffrey C. Bible MANAG ING DIRECTOR          11 November, 1983          Mr H. Maxwell,          Philip Morris International, 120 Park Avenue,          NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10017 ü.S.A. Dear Hamish, Attached are two substantial factory Upgrade proposals supporting capital requests for the Tobacco Company primary totalling U.S.$15.147 million and the make/pack area for U.S.$5.326 million. These proposals result from a comprehensive study of our present facility, our competitive position in terms of quality and productivity plus the company's needs over the next five years or so. Presently ß.A.T. in Australia are investing A$60 million in N.S.W. in order to consolidate their two existing plants into one modern facility. Rothmans on the other hand, with the equivalent of PML's total volume in one brand, have greater opportunity to realise productivity gains from high speed equipment. Our present primary and secondary equipment, with the exception of a small number of Mark Ni ne makers and Focke packers, is essentially 10 to 20 years old. Also the factory layout is still affected by the purchase of Godfrey Phillips in the early 1970s resulting in the Operation of two factories, Virginia and blended within the one facility. This results in poor utilisation and material handling efficiencies and it is our view that equipment integration and Upgrade can greatly improve our product quality and efficiency. In addition to the unnecessary split of Virginia and blended on the secondary floor, this facility also suffers from the rapid shift of the company's production from 20's HLP to 25‘s HLP over the last six years. The 25's capacity was achieved by locally engineered conversions from existing 20's equipment. .,.11 TELEPHONE: *34 2277. TELEX: 22S27 2048169414"
"Tobacco800";"xbk38d00-page02_2";"NextPage";" While this action reflected the needs of the time it has resulted in poor Standardisation of equipment. Additionally, much of the equipment converted was low speed Mol ins units purchased as reconditioned stock from Richmond in the late sixties.  These two proposals to a major degree allow for the correction of the Problems identified above and in our view should ensure competitive productivity and product quality for the foreseeable future.  You should note that the Australian tobacco Company already has approval to spend ü.S.$2.806 miIlion for New Primary weighbelts, dryers and cylinders. This amount is additional to the new request attached and the equipment authorised under the earlier capital appropriation has been fully integrated into the layouts shown in the new proposal.  Finally, as part of the total facilities development review we also assessed the feasibility of building a totally new factory in a different location. Apart from the fact that the cost of $60 miIlion plus was not seen as commercially prudent, the attendent industrial ramifications were assessed at such proportions as to make such a venture virtually unattainable.  We have carefully checked the proposals with T.T.G. personnel and where appropriate with original equipment manufacturers. I am satisfied that the proposals attached represent reasonable long term Upgrade plans that are achievable with the resources identified. I therefore submit these recommendations for your consideration and respectfully request your approval to seek Philip Morris Board approval for the capital identified.

Dear Mr. Potter:            I write on behalf of the Settling Defendants in the above-captioned action to confirm in writing what we have advised you orally:   that Final Äpproval has not yet occurred.            As you know, several counties and hospital districts have moved to intervene in this action for the purpose, inter alia, of moving under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 and 60 to amend and/or limit the Operation of the Court's Judgment approving the settlement herein. Those motions to intervene are still pending before the Court, and, of course, the Court's decision upon those motions will itself be subject to appeal. In addition, Governor Bush has also moved to intervene and has filed a notice of appeal with respect to the Judgment in this action.    9t             Under these circumstances, it is clear that ""Final — as that term is defined in Paragraph 4(h) of the parties' Comprehensive Settlement Agreement and Release — has  Approval   Ob   CM   üö   ro   Nb   CO   ■N"

Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 889 F.2d 1441, 1447-48 {5™ CirV”1989)7"" Moreover, Final Approval will not occur unless and until the pending motions of the putative intervenors are fully and finally resolved (including any appeals with respect to those motions}, such that the settlement is finally approved (including as set forth in Paragraphs 4 and 19 of the Settlement Agreement) and the Settling Defendants are assured that they have received the full and complete releases that they bargained for.            Accordingly, no term of the Settlement Agreement, of 1 the Escrow Agreement entered into in connection with the Settlement Agreement, or of any exhibit, rider or schedule to tho Settlement Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, that is contingent upon the occurrence of Final Approval has yet become effective.            In addition, with respect to the Settling Defendants' Obligation pursuant to Section 2(f)(i) of Exhibit 1 to the Settlement Agreement to advance $50 million to Private Counsel toward payment of attorneys' fees, that Obligation was tolled by Operation of Paragraph 3 of the Joint Motion, Stipulation and Order signed by the parties and Private Counsel and so ordered by the Court on February 20, 1998. As of February 20, ten days remained before the expiration of the 45-day time period in which the Settling Defendants' were required to make the advance payment of fees. As a result of the tolling agreement, that remaining ten-day period was preserved until the expiration of the tolling period, i.e., March 25, 1998. Hence, the Settling Defendants are not required to make the advance payment until ten days after March 25, i.e., April 4, 1998.

I share your hope that we.can expedite the Implementation of the proposal I gave you in my letter . of August 1, 1967j following the vlsit to High Tor on July 19th. As we both are aware, golng forward has been unhappily delayed by Dr, Hudson's preparatlon , for the hearings before the Senate Subcommlttee, the absence on vacation ln early August of some of the Research Directors, your being out of the country in early September, and the developed necessity for the Hazelton Laboratory people havlng to talk with Dr. Hudson before a testing protocol could be finalized.             Following our telephone talk on September 11, which was the first opportunity we had to talk on your return from Bermuda, and in which I told you that the Hazelton Laboratory people wanted to check certain scientific points with Dr. Hudson, I understand that he talked with Mr. James Gargus of that Organization. Thereafter, it was my understanding that Mr. Gargus would, with Dr, Robert Weir of Hazelton, work up a final protocol to be submitted to the, Research Dlrec-' tors of the Companies, and after approval be sent to me for Submission to you ln accordance with your request in our talk on August 10th, that everything go to you."

As I told you in our further conversatlon last Monday, I have repeatedly urged that these necessary steps be carrled forward as promptly as possible, and since nine Companies are concerned, these would take about ten days or two weeks. X am confident that these scientlsts are moving as fast as possible. Indeed, following my proposal letter of August Ist, a group of them immediately visited the' Hazeiton Laboratories ln Palls Church on August 4th to get that organlzation acquainted with the proposed Job of fully and promptly evaluating ""Chemosol."" Since I am not a scientist, and could contribute nothing to the protocol, I have not been ln those meetings and technical discusslons. Following each of our telephone calls, I have falth-fully endeavored to communlcate to the sclentists what you have told me.           In the meantime, I have been asked by repräsentatives of the interested Companies which authorized the letter proppsal of August Ist, 1967,, whether it had been accepted by you. In reporting to them, I forwarded coples of your letter of August lOth, 1967, and X had to state that your reply did not constltute an acceptance of the proposed testing prograin. To give you the complete plcture, I am enclosing a copy of my written report of September 8th which X wrote that day when I retumed from Cape Cod.           Just as soon as                        the protocol is received,                     I will send it to you,                and be available for further discusslons. I know that you appreciate                          that I am presently limited to                the                   proposal lett'er          of August 1, 1967, which I was authorized to give you, You have not förmally agreed as yet to that proposal and of course have retnained free to deal with anyone on any other basls, and to offer any other testing proposal. Once again, any proposal which you develop with Dr. Hudson will have to be consldered by the researeh sclentists of the Companies since I am neither com-petent nor authorized to deal with a testing protocol."

I am pleased to enclose a Statement describing policies of The Council and a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported. Our application procedure entails a mandatory two-step process. First, a short preliminarv inauirv is sent to members of the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluate it for scientific merit and for ""fit"" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. If the Committee’s review vote is positive, you will be provided with forms and instructions for completing a full application. In the event you receive an award, The Council will consider up to two annual renewals on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications.         The Council operates two application cycles per year and accepts preliminarv inauiries year-round; the date of receipt by CTR determines the cycle in which the proposal is evaluated. Spring cycle - any inquiry received between March 16 and September 15 and encouraged by the Executive Committee may be submitted as a full application by November 30.       Fall cycle - inquiries received between September 16 and March 15 and encouraged by the Committee may be submitted as full applications by May 31: Cycle  Preliminary Inquiry   Deadline for   Notification Activation           Arrival at CTR    Full Application     Date        Date     Spring   Mar 16 - Sep 15        Nov 30       Early May     Jul 1     Fall     Sep 16 - Mar 15        May 31       Early Oct     Jan 1     The format for the preliminary application is as follows: 1. A three page narrative summary. This should contain a synopsis of the proposed project including relevant background material, its present Status and goals, a brief outline of the research and its impact. The summary should end with a sentence indicating the anticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate of the anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three page limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature citations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the proposal, they must be accommodated within the three page limitation. 2. Two page curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal Professional level collaborators (the NIH format is quite acceptable). Again, the page limit is strictly enforced; only two pages per investigator are forwarded to the Committee. 3. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought. Arthur D. Eisenberg"

It’s always a pleasure to hear that there will be no rate increase.       I see frcm your rate card that you have a four time frequency discount of 20 percent per issue. I assume this also applies to those of us who advertise in four consecutive U.S. editions of The Atlantic Salmon Journal as well.       As usual, invoices should be submitted to us in both Canadian dollars and the U.S. dollar equivalent together with a copy of the publication.       I have let Mr. William Latshaw of The Leo Bumett Company know your closing dates, and material for the Spring, 1986 issue will be sent to you to meet your December 30 deadline.                                               Very truly yours,                                            f_                                               Kay L. G^aotti       /btm       cc: C. Beck W. Latshaw            D.

This measure requires Wholesale and retail dealers to take an inventory of all cigarettes on the effective date. Therefore,         at the        close of business on May 30, you are to      take a  complete inventory        of all packages of 20s in your possession bearing Maryland state tax stamps. This inventory must be in this       office  before June 5  so  we        may remit the tax due to the state.        If your territory includes another state in addition to Maryland and you are working in that state on May 30, you should not, of course, have any Maryland taxed merchandise on hand. However, you should inform us by letter to this effect.        The quantity of 20s reported on your inventory should be multiplied by 4 cents and this amount should be deducted from your Expense Account. Our Tax Department will remit the same amount to the State of Maryland.        Beginning on the effective date, you are to seil all merchandise in your possession at the new increased prices.        Please retain this letter as proof of the fact that the new tax rate has been complied with in the event you are questioned by an agent of the State Tax Commission. 055914 DUCED FROM B&W WEB SITE"

Standard cut rag was taken and put in a closed rotating cylinder for one day for moisture equilibrium. The cut rag was then sieved and only the middle fraction was used for the test. The samples were sent in double sealed polyethylene bags. Total weight was labeled on each bag and weight rechecked at reception ( in each lab.). Moisture results where too different weights were found, were not taken into consideration for the final evaluation. I hope that these informations will be useful to you.

Most of the changes concern brands lists, slogans and situations; and for each of these, a list has been addended to this letter. Marketing Research and Media Departments were involved in compiling these lists; however, they are in no particular order, so if you or Henry feel that further randomization is warranted, please do so. Other changes in the questionnaire have been discussed by Systems and Marketing Research. They are: 1. Demographics    .. Please be sure that the categories within each demographic question are the same ranges (and punch codes) as the telephone survey questionnaire. This will facilitate . combination/comparison of the two studies. 2. Respondent Instructions      For questions 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 the second sentence in the respondent instructions could be confusing. Perhaps what is meant is:   ""... in the row for each brand,"" or ""... in one      of the colunms next to each brand."" This is especially noteworthy when one notices that generally ""the column next to each ..."" is the negative response. 3. Negative, Neutral, Positive Order      In all of the questions mentioned above except number 8, the Order in which the response columns appear is negative, neutral, positive. Question 8, however, reverses that order both in layout and punch code. This can be confusing when working 670543488 PRODUCED FROM B&W WEB SITE 670543488"

If it is necessary to continue this reversed layout, might it be possible to reverse the punch codes, or the layout of the other questions?                    4. Tabulations                         Although not directly involved with the questionnaire, for - future tab books, please print the source question(s) for each table at the top of the page.

No. 8/3556, published   1/16/80)             Due to a decision of the 7th German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) dated 7/1/1976, the Federal Government was requested to prepare a comprehensive report on cancer and cancer research in the Federal Repüblic of Germany. The 51 page report was published 1/16/1980.             The report covers the following topics:             t gross outline of German cancer research (chapter II)             - epidemiology of cancer (chapter III)             - preventive measures (chapter IV)             - medical care of cancer patients (early diagnosis, therapy, post-therapeutical / post-operational measures) (chapter V)             - Status of cancer research (national and international Cooperation) (chapter VI)             - unconventional methods of cancer therapy (incl. preventive measures) (chapter VII)             - financial aid (chapter VIII)             - information and documentation (chapter IX).             - university Curriculum and further education (chapter X)             - establishment of cancer registers (chapters III, IV, V, annex I)             This review focusses on the Statements about smoking and carcinogenesis and the establishment of cancer registers.                                           ! l:C-iP-AT2 3 5CCO COlOGNiE ' C9C9 /.POOS"
"Tobacco800";"yda69d00-page02_2";"NextPage";"a)  Smoking and carcinogenesis:    Only about one page (all in all) is dedicated     to smoking.               o Smoking is considered a habit which increases cancer risk (chapters III - p. 4, IV - p. 17) and promotes cancer (chapter IV - p. 17).     o On the other hand it is conceded that the lung cancer rate in males and females has been nearly stagnant over the last 10 years.     o That matter of fact is however described as ""non contradictory"", because lung cancer does arise after an incubation period of 20-years (chapter III - p. 5). No reference is made to cigarettes consumption over that time period.     o Contradictory in that context is the Statement that up to 90 i of the             lung cancer are induced by noxious environmental factors (chapter IV- p. 17). b)  Cancer Register: It is planned to establish cancer registers on a regional basis. They shall contain type of cancer (diagnosis), stage of cancer growth, therapy, possible metastases, cause of death. c)  Parliamentary discussion: The cancer report was discussed in the 9th German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) January 21, 1981 (Parliamentary Protocol 9/14 pp. 433 (A) - 437 (D)).     In the review of the Minister of Youth, Family Affairs and Health smoking was not mentioned.     The parliamentariansof the ruling SPD (Social Democrats) and Opposition           J,     CDU (Christian democrats) however requested restrictive measures against           j     smoking and tobacco advertising, (because of its proven harmful consequences i to smokers), whereas SPD-coalition-partner FDP (Liberais) wamed to accept smoking as a harmful hazard since there were still many scientific doubts ! and inconsistencies. All three political parties principally supported the establishment of cancer registers, although they realized it will collidewith the law on the protection of personal data.                                                o.<M                                                   0.

H. Long Mr. C. G. Tompson Mr. G. B. Whitaker Dr. A. H. Laurene The attached MRD report addresses results of the SALEM HC Prototype Screening Test fielded on 2/4« Six 85mm and two 100mm prototypes were tested versus deflned competition, with product performance reported relative to current actlon Standards and on Individual attribute ratlngs. This preliminary round of testing was conducted to identlfy candldates for inclusion in the more extensive M.A.R.C. testing, which is currently underway. A final product deci-slon will be made ln May for both 85's and 100's based on the M.A.R.C. results. Sumnary of Key Flndlngs • One of six 85mm prototypes (Prototype ""G"") met the designated actlon Standards. Excluding ""G"", the prototypes were generally perceived to have an excess of menthol relative to competition, and to be harder to draw. • Prototype ""G” was rated superior (actlon Standard of parity) to Triumph overall and among .bothjtested suu-gioups• TlLv.uas.y aLL>.ibui.u auvautages were strength of taste, menthol level, coolness, draw and not leaving a bad aftertaste. Prototype ""G"" was a 4 mg., single-stage filter product. • Neither 100's prototype achieved actlon Standards. Prototype ""B"" (5 mg., dual-stage) achieved the Standard of superiority versus Carlton overall and among SALEM LIGHTS smokers, but was rated at parity among defined competi-tive smokers. In contrast to the 85's products, both 100’s prototypes were generally perceived as not having enough menthol relative to tobacco taste. Subsequent Action Although actlon Standards were met, the filter of the 85's ”G"" prototype was modified (menthol flavoring added) prior to its inclusion with three other 85's prototypes for M.A.R.C. Testing. This action was taken hy Tobacco Development based on internal panel tests which showed the modified ""G"" prototype to be preferred to the original Version.    mvsdmi  205 Bymaflfll"

The six samples represent a study of the following variables:     1) DUX-3 blend vs. LN-1 blend, 2) dextrose vs. propylene glycol as a carbon additive, and 3) Golic vs. propylene glycol-Gollc as a flavor carrier. The cigarette design is not yet optimised. The DUX-3 samples are low in flavor. Mouth drying is noticed after smoking pack quantities of all samples. There are no signifieant differentes in tat, 15-16 mg, nicotine 1.0-1.1 mg, or gas phase deliveries, between any of the cigarettes tested. All cigarettes deliver much less HCN, acetaldehyde and acrolein than any competitive cigarette. A 5 mm carbon bed, instead of the 8 mm presently used, would yield a cigarette comparable in gas phase delivery to Tempo, the lowest brand on the market. Smoke panel results indicate that the LN-1 blend imparts more flavor through the charcoal filters than the DUX-3 blend. The smoke panel cannot differentiate between the carbon additives or the flavor carriers. Attribute ratings for 323007 are found to be similar to Lark. Cigarettes are only one month old at this time. Further aging may change their smoking qualities. Improvements ""The flavor level on the DUX-3 blend has been increased, on Haunibaby samples, by using DOVER L0NG casing, and a fortified Version of the 944 flavor. Hand-injection indicates mouth dryness may be helped by Substitution of sodium benzoate for sodium citrate in #77 casing. Haunibaby samples are being prepared. Haunibaby samples made with triple-line perforated paper instead of 556 are promising. This modification would reduce tar, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides, and further reduce other gas phase deliveries. Alternates Initial tests indicate that Filtrona rods containing wheat flour and carbon bonded with polyethylene, have similar efficiencies and smoking properties to the present carbon granules. These could be used as an 8 im T section on a dual 25 mm filter, if the dual filter assembler is converted. It can be done quickly. Recommendations 1. Repeat 323007, the best of the present series, to serve as a Standard for subsequent improvements. 2. Assemble cigarettes with triple-line perforated paper. 3. Modify casing and flavor on DUX-3 to increase flavor level. 4. Use sodium benzoate in casing, (provided Haunibaby results satisfactory) ."

If these general recommendations are accepted, detailed sample specifications will be made. It is anticipated that slx or eight factory samples will be requested for manufacture during the week commencing May 26. It is suggested, that in view of the long time delay involved in evaluating charcoal cigarettes, market research codes be assigned to the samples, in anticipation of a satisfactory product.                                                              \j Ui                                                              H.

I have now heard from enough of these Companies, stating their view that the ""most favored nation"" Provision in the August 1, 1967 letter Is deemed essential, to require me, however regrettably, to teil you that the counter proposal in your letter of April 1, 1968, will not be acceptable.           Perhaps you will be interested in a quotation from one of these replies which observes:              ""From the point of view which I rep-resent as counsel to a Company which is a small factor in the cigarette field, it is absolutely essential that the terms upon which the Invention might be licensed by our dient must be no more onerous than the terms granted to ariy competitor. A 'most favored nation' clause Is essential.""           As the matter now Stands, I hope it will be possible for you to talk with Mr. Beck to the end that we may get agreement on the original proposal and the additional data relating to Appendix IX which I re-quested in my letter of March 5> 1968.           With best regards. Sincerely yours, bh                                                                                                                                                                  5SS«r . 1"

Moore Weekly Report - Oct. 14-29. 1973 Project 2903        G-7 Concentrated Extract        Site preparatlon for the G-7 extract concentration at 90-3 Building has been started. An Anacon on-line index of refraction meter for de-termination of soluble solids in G-7 extract to permit control of spray liquor concentration in G-7 plants has been received and is being tested. A bench model Anacon instrument utilizing the same principle has been found to give reproducible results after tests during a three week period developed a satisfactory operating technique.        G-7 Ammoniated Extract                  -   \                                                         N        G-7 sheet pH was increased from 5.3 to 5.9 in TPD-75 at 90-3 No. 4 Dryer by increasing the pH of the extract from 5.2 to 5.9 with ammonium hydroxide. Another test TPD-76 is scheduled in order to increase the pH of the G-7 sheet to above 6.0 for special blend tests.        G-13 Plant Operation        During period of high capacity Operation at Building 601 no mid-veek cleanouts of puffing duct were necessary when large FC-11 leaks through the air locks increased FC-11 content of duct gas, but when locks vere repaired mid week cleanouts were needed again. The G-13 Plant at Shed 130 was put back in Operation on October 15 after completion of the stainless steel sheAL for the Separator.        G-13 Plant Carbon Bed Corrosion        The G-13 Plant at Shed 130 is operating with only 2 carbon beds while the third bed is being recoated with Placite 6000 at Greensboro. Carbon bed losses are about 20 lbs./hr. compared to 10-15 lbs./hr. when 3 beds are in use. The beds show severe pitting where the original Heresite coating has flaked off and the steel contacts the carbon pellets. Specimens of several materials which are under test in the carbon bed at 601' indicate that none of the 400 series stainless nor copper will resist corrosion. However, FRP made of Dow Plastic Derakane 470, Hypalon coated and Coroline 580 coated steel, and Hastelloy C appear to be satisfactory, the first 3 after 10 weeks exposure."

The six samples represent a study of three variables: 1) DUX-3 blend vs. LN-1 blend, 2) dextrose vs. propylene glycol as a carbon additive, and 3) Golic vs. Grelanter-Golic as a flavor carrier. The 20 x 50 mesh BPL carbon was pretreated with 33% water and 1% of either dextrose or Grelanter additives. The carbon equilibrated to 25 + 1% water in all the charcoal cigarettes. This moisture content has been retained in the packs so far, but will be checked for a further 3 months. Sample numbers and a brief resume of the cigarettes are as follows: Sample No.    Carbon     Blend Casing Flavor                   323002      1% Dextrose  DUX-3  #77   #944 in Golic            323003     1% Grelanter  DUX-3  #77   #944 in Golic            323004      1% Dextrose  DUX-3  #77   #944 in Grelanter-Golic  323005     17» Grelanter DUX-3  #77   #944 in Grelanter-Golic  323006      1% Dextrose  LN-1   #77   #944 in Golic            323007     1% Grelanter  LN-1   #77   #944 in Grelanter-Golic  The sample cigarettes are all 84 x 25 mm, with 30 mm tipping and 25 mm filters, using 556 paper. The 25 mm filters have 8 1/2 mm of 3.9/40 acetate on the M and T sections with 8 mm of the treated BPL carbon in the center section. A tobacco density of 253 mgs/cc was the target for all samples. The #944 flavor is the same as #945 used on 323001 with the exception of deleting butyl stearate from the formulation.

The general appearance of the cigarettes was poor with a number of loose ends being encountered. Carbon granules are present between the inner and outer wraps of the filters. Manufacturing assure us that this problem can be overcome.  II Analytical Smoking Data  The reported deliveries were obtained by constant vacuum smoking of the cigarettes to 33 mm butt lengths. Cigarettes were randomly selected for smoking. Efficiencies were calculated after smoking individual tobacco sections (51 mm smoked).

Very little difference was noted in the results. Compared to constant vacuum smoking, the tars were generally 0.5 mg lower, and nicotine deliveries essentially the same, for the cigarettes by the Philip Morris procedure. These results show no significant differences in gas phase filtration between dextrose and propylene glycol as filter additives. Further, the deliveries from the charcoal cigarettes for all components measured, are similar for the DUX-3 and LN-1 blends.  The nicotine efficiencies for the filters attached to the LN-1 blend are significantly lower, however, than for those attached to DUX-3. The reasons for this are at present uncertain, but may be clarified when TPM pH data becomes available.  Smoke Quality  Now that the cigarettes have been aged for one month, rigorous panel testing can Start. The results of some earlier screening tests, which are attached, indicate that LN-1 imparts more flavor through charcoal filters than DUX-3. Attribute ratings for 323007 are similar to Lark, with which it apparently compares quite favorably.  Further Work                                                          620840087  Modifications to #77 casing are being continued on the laboratory scale since we"
"Tobacco800";"yru03f00-page03_3";"NextPage";"have noted that after smoking pack quantities of these cigarettes there is some feeling of mouth dryness.

I am pleased to enclose a Statement describing policies of The Council and a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported. Our application procedure entails a mandatory two-step process. First, a short preliminarv inauirv is sent to members of the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board who evaluate it for scientific merit and for ""fit"" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. If the Committee’s review vote is positive, you will be provided with forms and instructions for completing a full application. In the event you receive an award, The Council will consider up to two annual renewals on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications.         The Council operates two application cycles per year and accepts preliminarv inauiries year-round; the date of receipt by CTR determines the cycle in which the proposai is evaluated. Spring cycle - any inquiry received between February 16 and August 15 and encouraged by the Executive Committee may be submitted as a full application by November 30.       Fall cycle - inquiries received between August 16 and February 15 and encouraged by the Committee may be submitted as full applications by May 31:  Cycle Preliminary Inquiry   Deadline for   Notification Activation    Arrival at CTR    Full Application     Date     Date        Spring   Feb 16 - Aug 15        Nov 30       Early May   Jul 1         Fall   Aug 16 - Feb 15        May 31       Early Oct   Jan 1       The format for the preliminary application is as follows: 1. A three page narrative summary. This should contain a synopsis of the proposed project including relevant background material, its present status and goals, a brief outline of the research and its impact. The summary should end with a sentence indicating the anticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate of the anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three page limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature citations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the proposai, they must be accommodated within the three page limitation. 2. Two page curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal Professional level collaborators (the NIH format is quite acceptable). Again, the page limit is strictly enforced; only two pages per investigator are forwarded to the Committee. 3. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought. Encl- ADE/mla"

A previous panel (SIR 90-15 report dated 9/17/90) had indicated that Winston Ultra Lights 100's women smokers considered the Control model with pre-perforated to have significantly more appeal than the one with laser-perforated tipping.

Half of the panelists smoked the Control first and half the Test first. Panelists were instructed to answer questions on the questionnaire at various stages of smoking.

Results have been paired for ease of comparison.        The overall results indicated the two products had equivalent smoke charac-teristics. Younger smokers rated the Test model higher on draw, dryness, taste, harshness, bitterness, satisfaction and attitude. Women (74% of panel) and older smokers considered the two products to have equivalent smoke attributes.        Men tended to favor the Test model and rated it higher on most characteris-tics; however, the number of men on the panel are so few that their indica-tions are not reliable. III. Comparison with SIR 90-15 Panel        The SIR 90-15 panel was conducted during July/August 1990 to evaluate the effect on smoke appeal of using laser-perforated in lieu of pre-perforated tipping on MALIBU Ultra Lights 100's. Results of that study showed that Merit 100's and Vantage Ultra Lights 100's smokers considered the laser-perforated model to have smoke appeal equivalent to or slightly better than the product with pre-perforated tipping. However, Winston Ultra Lights 100's smokers indicated a Statistical ly significant preference for the pre-perforated model. The preference was due towomen smokers.        The current study was conducted to determine if the Winston women's original evaluation was valid or if it was an anomaly. Results of the study with a new group of Winston Ultra Lights 100's smokers indicated both men and women considered the products with pre-perforated and laser-perforated tipping to have equivalent smoke appeal and smoke characteristics. This suggests that the original preference was probably an anomaly. COWCLUSIOHS Results of this study indicated: 1. Winston Ultra Lights 100's men and women smokers considered MALIBU Ultra Lights 100's with pre-perforated and with laser-perforated tipping to have equivalent smoke appeal and smoke characteristics. 2. The standoff on smoke appeal suggests that the original evaluation by Winston Ultra Lights 100's women smokers (SIR 90-15) was probably an anomaly. mwt Attachments cc:     RDC,   JFA,  JGB"

Suite 410 Washington, D. C. 20006 Dear Mr. Roche:         Thank you very much for your gratifying letter of August 6th which I have today promptly distributed to the approprlate representative of each of the nlne Companies for whom I have been acting.         I do not at this time anticipate any difficulty with the understandings which you refer to in your letter. It has always been understood that American Chemosol Corporation or Dr. Hudson would be privileged to safe-guard the confidentiality of their formula in every way.         As to the establishment, which I take to mean the detailed formulation, of the protocol, there will certain-ly be no difficulty about Dr. Hudson being permitted to review that protocol. On the other hand, It must be understood that what constitutes an adequate procedure for evaluation must be ultimately determined by the independent testing laboratory. In addition, I can assure you that whatever progress reports are received in the regulär course of reporting from Hazleton will be made avail-able to the American Chemosol Corporation.         I am confIdent that you will understand that mid-August Is inescapably a difficult time to finalize any project because of vacation schedules. I shall ask each of my principals to act with reasonable expedition. TIFL 0533956 TIMN 267191"

"Tobacco800";"zkd43f00_1";"FirstPage";"Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation INVENTION DISCLOSURE TITLE      An Amadori Compound as a Flavorant in Tobacco Products BRIEF DESCRIPTION      A preparation of an Amadori compound has been isolated by chromatography from reaction mixtures with glucose, lysine, and water as major starting materials. This preparation has been identified as (S)-1-[(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)amino]-l-deoxy-D-fructose (Chemical Abstract Service Registry Number 21291-40-7). It has also been prepared by the reaction of glucose with N^alpha-carbobenzoxy-lysine followed by hydrogenolysis. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses indicated that the carbohydrate moiety of this Amadori compound existed in an aqueous solution as an equilibrium mixture of pyranose and furanose in both alpha- and beta-anomeric configurations.      When this compound was added to cigarettes at 100 ppm level, improved smoking qualities   were observed.       The use of this compound as  a tobacco flavorant yielded   flue-cured type                                 tobacco character, slightly      sweet, and also reduced Irritation. DATE OF CONCEPTION      March 28, 1980 B&W Laboratory Data Book No. 1469 p. 46.

Takahara et al., (Nippon Shokuhin Kogyo Gakkalshi, 17, 151-153,       1970) extracted from cocoa powder the following Amadori compounds 1-deoxy-1-L-alanino-H-f ructose, 1-deoxy-1-(L-glutamic acid)-D-fructose, l-deoxy-l-lfi-aspartic acid)-p-fructose. They also= studied the effects of these compounds on the tobacco smoking quality. 4. Nishi and Morishita (Nippon Nogei Kagaku Kaishi, 45, 507-512,       1971) studied the Amadori compounds in the methanolic extracts of licorice root and also found that 1-deoxy-l-L-prolino-D-fructose, 1-deoxy-1-L-alanino-D-fructose, 1-deoxy-l-(L-aspartic acid)-D-fructose, and 1-deoxy-1-L-asparagino-D-fructose were effective improving tobacco smoking quality. 5. British Patent 1,232,719 (Shimazaki et_ al., 1971) claimed a flavoring composition comprising           a          mixture of a first ingredient       prepared by heating at least one     amino acid and a reducing sugar  in       water, and a second ingredient prepared by heating cystine and/or cysteine and a reducing sugar in     a    fat or oil. The composition had       an aroraa and taste similar to that   of meat. 6. Japanese Patent 9,239 (Tamaki and Nöguchi, 1971) disclosed ""tobacco perfumes"" comprising raainly condensation products from sugar and amino acid. Amino acids to be used included mono- or dicarboxylic acids containing only one amino group or imino group such as proline, glutaraic acid, 2T-aminobutyric acid, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. The sugar components were mono- and disaccharides such as glucose, fructose, and maitose. These perfumes were prepared by reacting sugar with amino acid in an aqueous or alcohol solvent, and in the presence of an acid catalyst such as malonic acid. These compounds could be separated and purified by the use of ion-exchange resins and then applied to tobacco. 7. British Patent 1,285,568 (Godman and Osborne, 1972) called for flavoring substances capable of imparting to foodstaffs a savoury flavor particularly resembling that of cooked meats. These flavoring substances may be obtained by reaction of a mono-saccharide, hydrogen sulphide, and one or more amino acids in the presence of water at an elevated temperature.

Japanese Patent 3,398 (Takahara and Shinkai, 1973) disclosed that Amadori compounds such as 1-deoxy-1-^-alanino-S-fructose could be isolated from an amino acid-sugar reaction mixture and combined with cocoa to produce tobacco flavorants.      9. British Patent 1,378,112 (Liggett & Myers Inc., 1974) provided a method for preparing mixtures which are desirable as flavorants and flavor enhancers for tobacco products, comprising heating together the amino acid, valine, and a sugar or other carbonyl compound in the presence of a solvent at a temperature of 100°C to 200°C.      10. U. S. Patent 4,022,920 (Doornbos and van den Ouweland, 1977) claimed for a creamy, buttery flavor or aroma with a pleasant note, reminiscent of bread. This aroma was imparted to foodstuffs by heating them under controlled conditions in the presence of Amadori rearrangement compounds of 6-deoxy-aldohexoses, such as e.g., rhamnose, and alpha-amino acids, such as e.g., proline.      11. U. S. Patent 4,286,606 (Swain and Crayton, 1981) disclosed reaction mixtures for smoking materials by reacting a reducing sugar, ammonia, and carboxylic acid. The reaction products could be used as tobacco flavorants without additional processing.      12. U. S. Patent 4,306,577 (Wu and Swain, 1981) disclosed processes of preparing reaction flavors for smoking corapositions by reacting reducing sugars and selected amino acids such as asparagine, glutamine, arginine, and lysine in the presence of ammoniura hydroxide and optionally in the presence of an aldehyde in an essentially solvent-free system.                                                  777a? -C         Signature                                        Date Witnessed and Understood by: tch/inv/1022 bfw/452                                          620607941"

CAMEL Filter Blend (L-9870B)        Ecusta  856 paper       As indicated by the attached memo from Mr. Ken Swicegood, there is a difference in top-dressing formulas for our domestic brands, and those presently utilized by El Progreso for WINSTON CPB, and CAMEL FILTER. There is also a difference between the       R.J.R,  cased, blended strips    now being shipped to Ecuador, and domestic       CAMEL FILTER blend  used   in product B.

As you know., our analytical Services are inspecting, on a regulär basis, PM Europe's and competitors' cigarettes for all European markets. These rep-resent more than 250: brands. To dispose of such an apparatus would be a great time-saver for us and this apparatus could also be foreseen for use at QC production. In> the meantime, I was contactted by the firm Diversified Engineering, Inc. of Richmond which' is interested: in developping and building a prototype in collaborattion with ourselves. I sent a short description of the planned apparatus (see enclosure) to this firm and we decided: not to start development at FTR until we receive their quotation. Until now, I have received no written quota-tion, but during a phone conversation with the European director of Diversified Engineering, 1 learned that the price would be approx. $60,000. He also asked me if this device could not be developped in connection with PM USA. As Diversified1 Engineering is located in Richmond, this would considerably facilitate matters. Are you interested in such a device and what do you' think about this proposal ?                                                        /                                            PHILIP MORRIS EUROPE S.A. ^TÜ8CC00T"

Another run is planned using similar conditions.        The aeration-evaporator was used to concentrate extract for both No. 4 and No. 5 Dryers during most of the week because of extractor press tests at Bldg. 92-2. This helped to avoid below Standard flavors while 92 extract was weak.        A $125,000 price estimate for the 15,000 lb./hr. evaporator proposed for the G-7 production increase downtown has been received from Swenson Division. A six-to seven-month delivery time was quoted. This evaporator would permit up to a 20 per cent production increase if there were no bottlenecks in the other plant equipment used to prepare pulp and extract. o RMN:lc"

As you will notice, there is a considerable difference in smoke reduction between both types of tipping paper. This may be explained by the fact that the dilution measured does not correspond to the dilution-obtained on smoking machines. This study has been made with approximately ten dilution levels for both types of tipping paper and we still have some of the cigarettes. Should you be Interested, I could send you some cigarettes used for this study and you could then check your results with ours.                                t                           '   .

Since these contributions are being made from Institute general treasury funds, California law requires that the contributions be pro rated among the members of the Institute based upon dues assessments received by the Institute during the period of the campaign contributions.       Below is a chronological listing of your company's pro rata share of The Tobacco Institute California contributions:      As you know, this firm monitors your Company's campaign activity in California and discloses those contributions on a California Major Donor Campaign Statement if certain thresholds are met. The above captioned amounts will be disclosed both on The Tobacco Institute's campaign Statement and also on your Company's Major Donor Campaign Statement. If you have any questions regarding this allocation, please do not hesitate to contact Kirk Alan Pessner, our Senior Paralegal/Administrator of our Political Reports Unit or me.

First, Fee Payment Agreements have not been executed with respect to these States. Second, die submissions appear to seek re-imbursement for costs and expenses incurred by Hagens Berman only. Section 19 of Exhibit O to the Master Settlement Agreement expressly provides that the Designated Representative for a given state shall submit wa Cost Statement,” he-, a single statement, to the Original Participating Manufacturers.                      Accordingiy, in order to seek reimbursement for the reasonable costs and ex- penses of outside counsel in these States pursuant to the terms of Exhibit O, please send us Fee Payment Agreements that have been duly executed by each of the firms designated as outside                  00 counsel on MSA Exhibit S for Illinois, Montana, and Indiana, respectively. Thereafter, the                   ^ Original Participating Manufacturers will consider single, appropriately documented and attested            cn Cost Statements for each of these States, once they have been submitted.
